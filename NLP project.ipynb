But, in fact, households andeconomies have much in common.\\nA household faces many decisions. It must decide which members of the\\nhousehold do which tasks and what each member gets in return: Who cooks din-ner? Who does the laundry? Who gets the extra dessert at dinner? Who gets tochoose what TV show to watch? In short, the household must allocate its scarce re-sources among its various members, taking into account each member’s abilities,efforts, and desires.\\nLike a household, a society faces many decisions. A society must decide what\\njobs will be done and who will do them. It needs some people to grow food, otherpeople to make clothing, and still others to design computer software. Once soci-ety has allocated people (as well as land, buildings, and machines) to various jobs,TEN PRINCIPLES\\nOF ECONOMICS\\n3Consider why trade\\namong people or\\nnations can be good\\nfor everyone\\nDiscuss why markets\\nare a good, but not\\nperfect, way to\\nallocate resources\\nLearn what\\ndetermines some\\ntrends in the overall\\neconomy4 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nit must also allocate the output of goods and services that they produce. It must\\ndecide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes. It must decide who willdrive a Porsche and who will take the bus.\\nThe management of society’s resources is important because resources are\\nscarce. Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot pro-\\nduce all the goods and services people wish to have. Just as a household cannotgive every member everything he or she wants, a society cannot give every indi-vidual the highest standard of living to which he or she might aspire.\\nEconomics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources. In most\\nsocieties, resources are allocated not by a single central planner but through thecombined actions of millions of households and firms. Economists therefore studyhow people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much theysave, and how they invest their savings. Economists also study how people inter-act with one another. For instance, they examine how the multitude of buyers andsellers of a good together determine the price at which the good is sold and thequantity that is sold. Finally, economists analyze forces and trends that affectthe economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction ofthe population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising.\\nAlthough the study of economics has many facets, the field is unified by sev-\\neral central ideas. In the rest of this chapter, we look at Ten Principles of Economics.\\nThese principles recur throughout this book and are introduced here to give youan overview of what economics is all about. You can think of this chapter as a “pre-view of coming attractions.”\\nHOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS\\nThere is no mystery to what an “economy” is. Whether we are talking about theeconomy of Los Angeles, of the United States, or of the whole world, an economyis just a group of people interacting with one another as they go about their lives.Because the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals whomake up the economy, we start our study of economics with four principles of in-dividual decisionmaking.\\nPRINCIPLE #1: PEOPLE FACE TRADEOFFS\\nThe first lesson about making decisions is summarized in the adage: “There is nosuch thing as a free lunch.” To get one thing that we like, we usually have to giveup another thing that we like. Making decisions requires trading off one goalagainst another.\\nConsider a student who must decide how to allocate her most valuable re-\\nsource—her time. She can spend all of her time studying economics; she can spendall of her time studying psychology; or she can divide her time between the twofields. For every hour she studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could haveused studying the other. And for every hour she spends studying, she gives up anhour that she could have spent napping, bike riding, watching TV , or working ather part-time job for some extra spending money.scarcity\\nthe limited nature of society’sresources\\neconomics\\nthe study of how society manages itsscarce resources\\nCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 5\\nOr consider parents deciding how to spend their family income. They can buy\\nfood, clothing, or a family vacation. Or they can save some of the family incomefor retirement or the children’s college education. When they choose to spend anextra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on someother good.\\nWhen people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of tradeoffs.\\nThe classic tradeoff is between “guns and butter.” The more we spend on nationaldefense to protect our shores from foreign aggressors (guns), the less we can spendon consumer goods to raise our standard of living at home (butter). Also importantin modern society is the tradeoff between a clean environment and a high level ofincome. Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the cost of producinggoods and services. Because of the higher costs, these firms end up earning smallerprofits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some combination of thesethree. Thus, while pollution regulations give us the benefit of a cleaner environ-ment and the improved health that comes with it, they have the cost of reducingthe incomes of the firms’ owners, workers, and customers.\\nAnother tradeoff society faces is between efficiency and equity. Efficiency\\nmeans that society is getting the most it can from its scarce resources. Equity\\nmeans that the benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among society’smembers. In other words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, andequity refers to how the pie is divided. Often, when government policies are beingdesigned, these two goals conflict.\\nConsider, for instance, policies aimed at achieving a more equal distribution of\\neconomic well-being. Some of these policies, such as the welfare system or unem-ployment insurance, try to help those members of society who are most in need.Others, such as the individual income tax, ask the financially successful to con-tribute more than others to support the government. Although these policies havethe benefit of achieving greater equity, they have a cost in terms of reduced effi-ciency. When the government redistributes income from the rich to the poor, it re-duces the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and producefewer goods and services. In other words, when the government tries to cut theeconomic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.\\nRecognizing that people face tradeoffs does not by itself tell us what decisions\\nthey will or should make. A student should not abandon the study of psychologyjust because doing so would increase the time available for the study of econom-ics. Society should not stop protecting the environment just because environmen-tal regulations reduce our material standard of living. The poor should not beignored just because helping them distorts work incentives. Nonetheless, ac-knowledging life’s tradeoffs is important because people are likely to make gooddecisions only if they understand the options that they have available.\\nPRINCIPLE #2: THE COST OF SOMETHING IS\\nWHAT YOU GIVE UP TO GET IT\\nBecause people face tradeoffs, making decisions requires comparing the costs and\\nbenefits of alternative courses of action. In many cases, however, the cost of someaction is not as obvious as it might first appear.\\nConsider, for example, the decision whether to go to college. The benefit is in-\\ntellectual enrichment and a lifetime of better job opportunities. But what is thecost? To answer this question, you might be tempted to add up the money youefficiency\\nthe property of society getting themost it can from its scarce resources\\nequity\\nthe property of distributing economicprosperity fairly among the membersof society6 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nspend on tuition, books, room, and board. Yet this total does not truly represent\\nwhat you give up to spend a year in college.\\nThe first problem with this answer is that it includes some things that are not\\nreally costs of going to college. Even if you quit school, you would need a place tosleep and food to eat. Room and board are costs of going to college only to the ex-tent that they are more expensive at college than elsewhere. Indeed, the cost ofroom and board at your school might be less than the rent and food expenses thatyou would pay living on your own. In this case, the savings on room and boardare a benefit of going to college.\\nThe second problem with this calculation of costs is that it ignores the largest\\ncost of going to college—your time. When you spend a year listening to lectures,reading textbooks, and writing papers, you cannot spend that time working at ajob. For most students, the wages given up to attend school are the largest singlecost of their education.\\nThe opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item. When\\nmaking any decision, such as whether to attend college, decisionmakers should beaware of the opportunity costs that accompany each possible action. In fact, theyusually are. College-age athletes who can earn millions if they drop out of schooland play professional sports are well aware that their opportunity cost of collegeis very high. It is not surprising that they often decide that the benefit is not worththe cost.\\nPRINCIPLE #3: RATIONAL PEOPLE THINK AT THE MARGIN\\nDecisions in life are rarely black and white but usually involve shades of gray.When it’s time for dinner, the decision you face is not between fasting or eatinglike a pig, but whether to take that extra spoonful of mashed potatoes. When ex-ams roll around, your decision is not between blowing them off or studying 24hours a day, but whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes instead ofwatching TV . Economists use the term marginal changes to describe small incre-\\nmental adjustments to an existing plan of action. Keep in mind that “margin”means “edge,” so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what youare doing.\\nIn many situations, people make the best decisions by thinking at the margin.\\nSuppose, for instance, that you asked a friend for advice about how many years tostay in school. If he were to compare for you the lifestyle of a person with a Ph.D.to that of a grade school dropout, you might complain that this comparison is nothelpful for your decision. You have some education already and most likely aredeciding whether to spend an extra year or two in school. To make this decision,you need to know the additional benefits that an extra year in school would offer(higher wages throughout life and the sheer joy of learning) and the additionalcosts that you would incur (tuition and the forgone wages while you’re in school).By comparing these marginal benefits and marginal costs, you can evaluate whether\\nthe extra year is worthwhile.\\nAs another example, consider an airline deciding how much to charge passen-\\ngers who fly standby. Suppose that flying a 200-seat plane across the country coststhe airline $100,000. In this case, the average cost of each seat is $100,000/200,which is $500. One might be tempted to conclude that the airline should neversell a ticket for less than $500. In fact, however, the airline can raise its profits byopportunity cost\\nwhatever must be given up to obtainsome item\\nmarginal changes\\nsmall incremental adjustments to aplan of actionCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 7\\nthinking at the margin. Imagine that a plane is about to take off with ten empty\\nseats, and a standby passenger is waiting at the gate willing to pay $300 for a seat.Should the airline sell it to him? Of course it should. If the plane has empty seats,the cost of adding one more passenger is minuscule. Although the average cost of\\nflying a passenger is $500, the marginal cost is merely the cost of the bag of peanuts\\nand can of soda that the extra passenger will consume. As long as the standby pas-senger pays more than the marginal cost, selling him a ticket is profitable.\\nAs these examples show, individuals and firms can make better decisions by\\nthinking at the margin. A rational decisionmaker takes an action if and only if themarginal benefit of the action exceeds the marginal cost.\\nPRINCIPLE #4: PEOPLE RESPOND TO INCENTIVES\\nBecause people make decisions by comparing costs and benefits, their behaviormay change when the costs or benefits change. That is, people respond to incen-tives. When the price of an apple rises, for instance, people decide to eat morepears and fewer apples, because the cost of buying an apple is higher. At the sametime, apple orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples, be-cause the benefit of selling an apple is also higher. As we will see, the effect of priceon the behavior of buyers and sellers in a market—in this case, the market forapples—is crucial for understanding how the economy works.\\nPublic policymakers should never forget about incentives, for many policies\\nchange the costs or benefits that people face and, therefore, alter behavior. A tax ongasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.It also encourages people to take public transportation rather than drive and tolive closer to where they work. If the tax were large enough, people would startdriving electric cars.\\nWhen policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they\\ncan end up with results that they did not intend. For example, consider public pol-icy regarding auto safety. Today all cars have seat belts, but that was not true 40years ago. In the late 1960s, Ralph Nader’s book Unsafe at Any Speed generated\\nmuch public concern over auto safety. Congress responded with laws requiring carcompanies to make various safety features, including seat belts, standard equip-ment on all new cars.\\nHow does a seat belt law affect auto safety? The direct effect is obvious. With\\nseat belts in all cars, more people wear seat belts, and the probability of survivinga major auto accident rises. In this sense, seat belts save lives.\\nBut that’s not the end of the story. To fully understand the effects of this law,\\nwe must recognize that people change their behavior in response to the incentivesthey face. The relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which drivers op-erate their cars. Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the driver’stime and energy. When deciding how safely to drive, rational people compare themarginal benefit from safer driving to the marginal cost. They drive more slowlyand carefully when the benefit of increased safety is high. This explains why peo-ple drive more slowly and carefully when roads are icy than when roads are clear.\\nNow consider how a seat belt law alters the cost–benefit calculation of a ratio-\\nnal driver. Seat belts make accidents less costly for a driver because they reducethe probability of injury or death. Thus, a seat belt law reduces the benefits to slowand careful driving. People respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement\\nBASKETBALL STAR KOBEBRYANT\\nUNDERSTANDS OPPORTUNITY COST ANDINCENTIVES\\n.

The end result of a seat belt\\nlaw, therefore, is a larger number of accidents.\\nHow does the law affect the number of deaths from driving? Drivers who\\nwear their seat belts are more likely to survive any given accident, but they are alsomore likely to find themselves in an accident. The net effect is ambiguous. More-over, the reduction in safe driving has an adverse impact on pedestrians (and ondrivers who do not wear their seat belts). They are put in jeopardy by the law be-cause they are more likely to find themselves in an accident but are not protectedby a seat belt. Thus, a seat belt law tends to increase the number of pedestriandeaths.\\nAt first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle spec-\\nulation. Yet, in a 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman showed that the auto-safetylaws have, in fact, had many of these effects. According to Peltzman’s evidence,these laws produce both fewer deaths per accident and more accidents. The net re-sult is little change in the number of driver deaths and an increase in the numberof pedestrian deaths.\\nPeltzman’s analysis of auto safety is an example of the general principle that\\npeople respond to incentives. Many incentives that economists study are morestraightforward than those of the auto-safety laws. No one is surprised that peopledrive smaller cars in Europe, where gasoline taxes are high, than in the UnitedStates, where gasoline taxes are low. Yet, as the seat belt example shows, policiescan have effects that are not obvious in advance. When analyzing any policy, wemust consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects that workthrough incentives. If the policy changes incentives, it will cause people to altertheir behavior.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the four principles of individual \\ndecisionmaking.\\nHOW PEOPLE INTERACT\\nThe first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions. As we\\ngo about our lives, many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but otherpeople as well. The next three principles concern how people interact with oneanother.\\nPRINCIPLE #5: TRADE CAN MAKE EVERYONE BETTER OFF\\nYou have probably heard on the news that the Japanese are our competitors in theworld economy. In some ways, this is true, for American and Japanese firms doproduce many of the same goods. Ford and Toyota compete for the same cus-tomers in the market for automobiles. Compaq and Toshiba compete for the samecustomers in the market for personal computers.\\nYet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries.\\nTrade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest, where oneCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 9\\nside wins and the other side loses. In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two\\ncountries can make each country better off.\\nTo see why, consider how trade affects your family. When a member of your\\nfamily looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families whoare looking for jobs. Families also compete against one another when they goshopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices. So,in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.\\nDespite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself\\nfrom all other families. If it did, your family would need to grow its own food,make its own clothes, and build its own home. Clearly, your family gains muchfrom its ability to trade with others. Trade allows each person to specialize in theactivities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building. Bytrading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services atlower cost.\\nCountries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another.\\nTrade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater va-riety of goods and services. The Japanese, as well as the French and the Egyptiansand the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are ourcompetitors.\\nPRINCIPLE #6: MARKETS ARE USUALLY A GOOD WAY\\nTO ORGANIZE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY\\nThe collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe may be the\\nmost important change in the world during the past half century. Communistcountries worked on the premise that central planners in the government were inthe best position to guide economic activity. These planners decided what goodsand services were produced, how much was produced, and who produced andconsumed these goods and services. The theory behind central planning was thatonly the government could organize economic activity in a way that promotedeconomic well-being for the country as a whole.\\nToday, most countries that once had centrally planned economies have aban-\\ndoned this system and are trying to develop market economies. In a market econ-\\nomy, the decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of\\nfirms and households. Firms decide whom to hire and what to make. Householdsdecide which firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes. These firmsand households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guidetheir decisions.\\nAt first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling. After all, in a mar-\\nket economy, no one is looking out for the economic well-being of society asa whole. Free markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods andservices, and all of them are interested primarily in their own well-being. Yet,despite decentralized decisionmaking and self-interested decisionmakers, marketeconomies have proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity ina way that promotes overall economic well-being.\\nIn his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,\\neconomist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics:Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an “in-visible hand” that leads them to desirable market outcomes. One of our goals in\\n“For $5 a week you can watch\\nbaseball without being nagged tocut the grass!”\\nmarket economy\\nan economy that allocates resourcesthrough the decentralized decisionsof many firms and households asthey interact in markets for goodsand services10 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nthis book is to understand how this invisible hand works its magic. As you study\\neconomics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with which the invisiblehand directs economic activity. Prices reflect both the value of a good to societyand the cost to society of making the good. Because households and firms look atprices when deciding what to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into accountthe social benefits and costs of their actions. As a result, prices guide these indi-vidual decisionmakers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, maximize the wel-fare of society as a whole.\\nThere is an important corollary to the skill of the invisible hand in guiding eco-\\nnomic activity: When the government prevents prices from adjusting naturally tosupply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand’s ability to coordinate the mil-lions of households and firms that make up the economy. This corollary explainswhy taxes adversely affect the allocation of resources: Taxes distort prices and thusthe decisions of households and firms. It also explains the even greater harmcaused by policies that directly control prices, such as rent control. And it explainsthe failure of communism. In communist countries, prices were not determined inthe marketplace but were dictated by central planners. These planners lacked theinformation that gets reflected in prices when prices are free to respond to market\\nIt may be only a coincidence\\nthat Adam Smith’s great book,An Inquiry into the Nature andCauses of the Wealth of Na-tions, was published in 1776,\\nthe exact year American revolu-tionaries signed the Declara-tion of Independence. But thetwo documents do share apoint of view that was preva-lent at the time—that individu-als are usually best left to theirown devices, without the heavy\\nhand of government guiding their actions. This political phi-losophy provides the intellectual basis for the market econ-omy, and for free society more generally.\\nWhy do decentralized market economies work so\\nwell? Is it because people can be counted on to treat oneanother with love and kindness? Not at all. Here is AdamSmith’s description of how people interact in a marketeconomy:\\nMan has almost constant occasion for the help of his\\nbrethren, and it is vain for him to expect it from theirbenevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if hecan interest their self-love in his favor, and show themthat it is for their own advantage to do for him what herequires of them. . . . It is not from the benevolence ofthe butcher, the brewer, or \\nthe baker that we expect ourdinner, but from their regardto their own interest. . . .\\nEvery individual . . .\\nneither intends to promotethe public interest, nor knowshow much he is promotingit. . . . He intends only hisown gain, and he is in this, asin many other cases, led byan invisible hand to promotean end which was no part ofhis intention. Nor is it alwaysthe worse for the society thatit was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest hefrequently promotes that of the society more effectuallythan when he really intends to promote it.\\nSmith is saying that participants in the economy are moti-\\nvated by self-interest and that the “invisible hand” of themarketplace guides this self-interest into promoting generaleconomic well-being.\\nMany of Smith’s insights remain at the center of mod-\\nern economics. Our analysis in the coming chapters will al-low us to express Smith’s conclusions more precisely andto analyze fully the strengths and weaknesses of the mar-ket’s invisible hand.\\nADAMSMITHFYI\\nAdam Smith\\nand the\\nInvisible Hand\\nCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 11\\nforces. Central planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one\\nhand tied behind their backs—the invisible hand of the marketplace.\\nPRINCIPLE #7: GOVERNMENTS CAN SOMETIMES\\nIMPROVE MARKET OUTCOMES\\nAlthough markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity, this rule\\nhas some important exceptions. There are two broad reasons for a government tointervene in the economy: to promote efficiency and to promote equity. That is,most policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie isdivided.\\nThe invisible hand usually leads markets to allocate resources efficiently.\\nNonetheless, for various reasons, the invisible hand sometimes does not work.Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in which the market\\non its own fails to allocate resources efficiently.\\nOne possible cause of market failure is an externality. An externality is the im-\\npact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. The classic exampleof an external cost is pollution. If a chemical factory does not bear the entire cost ofthe smoke it emits, it will likely emit too much. Here, the government can raiseeconomic well-being through environmental regulation. The classic example of anexternal benefit is the creation of knowledge. When a scientist makes an importantdiscovery, he produces a valuable resource that other people can use. In this case,the government can raise economic well-being by subsidizing basic research, as infact it does.\\nAnother possible cause of market failure is market power. Market power\\nrefers to the ability of a single person (or small group of people) to unduly influ-ence market prices. For example, suppose that everyone in town needs water butthere is only one well. The owner of the well has market power—in this case amonopoly —over the sale of water. The well owner is not subject to the rigorous\\ncompetition with which the invisible hand normally keeps self-interest in check.You will learn that, in this case, regulating the price that the monopolist chargescan potentially enhance economic efficiency.\\nThe invisible hand is even less able to ensure that economic prosperity is dis-\\ntributed fairly. A market economy rewards people according to their ability to pro-duce things that other people are willing to pay for. The world’s best basketballplayer earns more than the world’s best chess player simply because people arewilling to pay more to watch basketball than chess. The invisible hand does not en-sure that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate health care.A goal of many public policies, such as the income tax and the welfare system, isto achieve a more equitable distribution of economic well-being.\\nTo say that the government canimprove on markets outcomes at times does\\nnot mean that it always will. Public policy is made not by angels but by a political\\nprocess that is far from perfect. Sometimes policies are designed simply to rewardthe politically powerful. Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaderswho are not fully informed. One goal of the study of economics is to help youjudge when a government policy is justifiable to promote efficiency or equity andwhen it is not.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the three principles concerning \\neconomic interactions.market failure\\na situation in which a market left onits own fails to allocate resourcesefficiently\\nexternality\\nthe impact of one person’s actions onthe well-being of a bystander\\nmarket power\\nthe ability of a single economic actor(or small group of actors) to have asubstantial influence on marketprices12 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nHOW THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WORKS\\nWe started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how\\npeople interact with one another. All these decisions and interactions togethermake up “the economy.” The last three principles concern the workings of theeconomy as a whole.\\nPRINCIPLE #8: A COUNTRY’S STANDARD OF\\nLIVING DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TOPRODUCE GOODS AND SERVICES\\nThe differences in living standards around the world are staggering. In 1997 the\\naverage American had an income of about $29,000. In the same year, the averageMexican earned $8,000, and the average Nigerian earned $900. Not surprisingly,this large variation in average income is reflected in various measures of the qual-ity of life. Citizens of high-income countries have more TV sets, more cars, betternutrition, better health care, and longer life expectancy than citizens of low-incomecountries.\\nChanges in living standards over time are also large. In the United States,\\nincomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting forchanges in the cost of living). At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years.Over the past century, average income has risen about eightfold.\\nWhat explains these large differences in living standards among countries and\\nover time? The answer is surprisingly simple. Almost all variation in living stan-dards is attributable to differences in countries’ productivity —that is, the amount\\nof goods and services produced from each hour of a worker’s time. In nationswhere workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per unit of time,most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are lessproductive, most people must endure a more meager existence. Similarly, thegrowth rate of a nation’s productivity determines the growth rate of its averageincome.\\nThe fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is\\nsimple, but its implications are far-reaching. If productivity is the primary deter-minant of living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance.For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage lawsfor the rise in living standards of American workers over the past century. Yet thereal hero of American workers is their rising productivity. As another example,some commentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan andother countries explains the slow growth in U.S. incomes over the past 30 years.Yet the real villain is not competition from abroad but flagging productivitygrowth in the United States.\\nThe relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound\\nimplications for public policy. When thinking about how any policy will affect liv-ing standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goodsand services. To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity byensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools needed to produce goodsand services, and have access to the best available technology.productivity\\nthe amount of goods and servicesproduced from each hour of aworker’s timeCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 13\\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, for example, much debate in the United States centered\\non the government’s budget deficit—the excess of government spending over gov-ernment revenue. As we will see, concern over the budget deficit was basedlargely on its adverse impact on productivity. When the government needs tofinance a budget deficit, it does so by borrowing in financial markets, much as astudent might borrow to finance a college education or a firm might borrow tofinance a new factory. As the government borrows to finance its deficit, therefore,it reduces the quantity of funds available for other borrowers. The budget deficitthereby reduces investment both in human capital (the student’s education) andphysical capital (the firm’s factory). Because lower investment today means lowerproductivity in the future, government budget deficits are generally thought to de-press growth in living standards.\\nPRINCIPLE #9: PRICES RISE WHEN THE\\nGOVERNMENT PRINTS TOO MUCH MONEY\\nIn Germany in January 1921, a daily newspaper cost 0.30 marks. Less than two\\nyears later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks. Allother prices in the economy rose by similar amounts. This episode is one of his-tory’s most spectacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of\\nprices in the economy.\\nAlthough the United States has never experienced inflation even close to that\\nin Germany in the 1920s, inflation has at times been an economic problem. Duringthe 1970s, for instance, the overall level of prices more than doubled, and PresidentGerald Ford called inflation “public enemy number one.” By contrast, inflation inthe 1990s was about 3 percent per year; at this rate it would take more thaninflation\\nan increase in the overall level ofprices in the economy\\n“Well it may have been 68 cents when you got in line, but it’s 74 cents now!”14 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\n20 years for prices to double. Because high inflation imposes various costs on soci-\\nety, keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of economic policymakers around theworld.\\nWhat causes inflation? In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the\\nculprit turns out to be the same—growth in the quantity of money. When a gov-ernment creates large quantities of the nation’s money, the value of the moneyfalls. In Germany in the early 1920s, when prices were on average tripling everymonth, the quantity of money was also tripling every month. Although less dra-matic, the economic history of the United States points to a similar conclusion: Thehigh inflation of the 1970s was associated with rapid growth in the quantity ofmoney, and the low inflation of the 1990s was associated with slow growth in thequantity of money.\\nPRINCIPLE #10: SOCIETY FACES A SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF\\nBETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT\\nIf inflation is so easy to explain, why do policymakers sometimes have trouble rid-\\nding the economy of it? One reason is that reducing inflation is often thought tocause a temporary rise in unemployment. The curve that illustrates this tradeoffbetween inflation and unemployment is called the Phillips curve, after the econo-\\nmist who first examined this relationship.\\nThe Phillips curve remains a controversial topic among economists, but most\\neconomists today accept the idea that there is a short-run tradeoff between infla-tion and unemployment. This simply means that, over a period of a year or two,many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.Policymakers face this tradeoff regardless of whether inflation and unemploymentboth start out at high levels (as they were in the early 1980s), at low levels (as theywere in the late 1990s), or someplace in between.\\nWhy do we face this short-run tradeoff? According to a common explanation,\\nit arises because some prices are slow to adjust. Suppose, for example, that thegovernment reduces the quantity of money in the economy. In the long run, theonly result of this policy change will be a fall in the overall level of prices. Yet notall prices will adjust immediately. It may take several years before all firms issuenew catalogs, all unions make wage concessions, and all restaurants print newmenus. That is, prices are said to be sticky in the short run.\\nBecause prices are sticky, various types of government policy have short-run\\neffects that differ from their long-run effects. When the government reduces thequantity of money, for instance, it reduces the amount that people spend. Lowerspending, together with prices that are stuck too high, reduces the quantity ofgoods and services that firms sell. Lower sales, in turn, cause firms to lay off work-ers. Thus, the reduction in the quantity of money raises unemployment temporar-ily until prices have fully adjusted to the change.\\nThe tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is only temporary, but it\\ncan last for several years. The Phillips curve is, therefore, crucial for understand-ing many developments in the economy. In particular, policymakers can exploitthis tradeoff using various policy instruments. By changing the amount that thegovernment spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints,policymakers can, in the short run, influence the combination of inflation andunemployment that the economy experiences. Because these instruments ofPhillips curve\\na curve that shows the short-runtradeoff between inflation andunemploymentCHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS 15\\nmonetary and fiscal policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers should\\nuse these instruments to control the economy, if at all, is a subject of continuingdebate.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the three principles that describe \\nhow the economy as a whole works.\\nCONCLUSION\\nYou now have a taste of what economics is all about.

Of course, just as you cannot become a mathematician,psychologist, or lawyer overnight, learning to think like an economist will takeTHINKING LIKE\\nAN ECONOMIST\\n19Examine the role of\\neconomists in\\nmaking policy\\nConsider why\\neconomists\\nsometimes disagree\\nwith one another20 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nsome time. Yet with a combination of theory, case studies, and examples of eco-\\nnomics in the news, this book will give you ample opportunity to develop andpractice this skill.\\nBefore delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to have\\nan overview of how economists approach the world. This chapter, therefore, dis-cusses the field’s methodology. What is distinctive about how economists confronta question? What does it mean to think like an economist?\\nTHE ECONOMIST AS SCIENTIST\\nEconomists try to address their subject with a scientist’s objectivity. They approachthe study of the economy in much the same way as a physicist approaches thestudy of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life: They devise theories,collect data, and then analyze these data in an attempt to verify or refute theirtheories.\\nTo beginners, it can seem odd to claim that economics is a science. After\\nall, economists do not work with test tubes or telescopes. The essence of science,\\n“I’m a social scientist, Michael. That means I can’t explain\\nelectricity or anything like that, but if you ever want to know\\nabout people I’m your man.”CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 21\\nhowever, is the scientific method —the dispassionate development and testing of\\ntheories about how the world works. This method of inquiry is as applicable tostudying a nation’s economy as it is to studying the earth’s gravity or a species’evolution. As Albert Einstein once put it, “The whole of science is nothing morethan the refinement of everyday thinking.”\\nAlthough Einstein’s comment is as true for social sciences such as economics\\nas it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed tolooking at society through the eyes of a scientist. Let’s therefore discuss some ofthe ways in which economists apply the logic of science to examine how an econ-omy works.\\nTHE SCIENTIFIC METHOD: OBSERVATION,\\nTHEORY, AND MORE OBSERVATION\\nIsaac Newton, the famous seventeenth-century scientist and mathematician, al-\\nlegedly became intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from an apple tree.This observation motivated Newton to develop a theory of gravity that applies notonly to an apple falling to the earth but to any two objects in the universe. Subse-quent testing of Newton’s theory has shown that it works well in many circum-stances (although, as Einstein would later emphasize, not in all circumstances).Because Newton’s theory has been so successful at explaining observation, it isstill taught today in undergraduate physics courses around the world.\\nThis interplay between theory and observation also occurs in the field of eco-\\nnomics. An economist might live in a country experiencing rapid increases inprices and be moved by this observation to develop a theory of inflation. Thetheory might assert that high inflation arises when the government prints toomuch money. (As you may recall, this was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in\\nChapter 1.) To test this theory, the economist could collect and analyze data onprices and money from many different countries. If growth in the quantity ofmoney were not at all related to the rate at which prices are rising, the economistwould start to doubt the validity of his theory of inflation. If money growth and in-flation were strongly correlated in international data, as in fact they are, the econ-omist would become more confident in his theory.\\nAlthough economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they do\\nface an obstacle that makes their task especially challenging: Experiments are oftendifficult in economics. Physicists studying gravity can drop many objects in theirlaboratories to generate data to test their theories. By contrast, economists study-ing inflation are not allowed to manipulate a nation’s monetary policy simply togenerate useful data. Economists, like astronomers and evolutionary biologists,usually have to make do with whatever data the world happens to give them.\\nTo find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention\\nto the natural experiments offered by history. When a war in the Middle East in-terrupts the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world.For consumers of oil and oil products, such an event depresses living standards.For economic policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best to respond.But for economic scientists, it provides an opportunity to study the effects of a keynatural resource on the world’s economies, and this opportunity persists long afterthe wartime increase in oil prices is over. Throughout this book, therefore, we con-sider many historical episodes. These episodes are valuable to study because they\\n22 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\ngive us insight into the economy of the past and, more important, because they al-\\nlow us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present.\\nTHE ROLE OF ASSUMPTIONS\\nIf you ask a physicist how long it would take for a marble to fall from the top of aten-story building, she will answer the question by assuming that the marble fallsin a vacuum. Of course, this assumption is false. In fact, the building is surroundedby air, which exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down. Yet the physi-cist will correctly point out that friction on the marble is so small that its effect isnegligible. Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum greatly simplifies the problemwithout substantially affecting the answer.\\nEconomists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can make\\nthe world easier to understand. To study the effects of international trade, for ex-ample, we may assume that the world consists of only two countries and that eachcountry produces only two goods. Of course, the real world consists of dozens ofcountries, each of which produces thousands of different types of goods. But by as-suming two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking. Once we under-stand international trade in an imaginary world with two countries and twogoods, we are in a better position to understand international trade in the morecomplex world in which we live.\\nThe art in scientific thinking—whether in physics, biology, or economics—is\\ndeciding which assumptions to make. Suppose, for instance, that we were drop-ping a beach ball rather than a marble from the top of the building. Our physicistwould realize that the assumption of no friction is far less accurate in this case:Friction exerts a greater force on a beach ball than on a marble. The assumptionthat gravity works in a vacuum is reasonable for studying a falling marble but notfor studying a falling beach ball.\\nSimilarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different questions.\\nSuppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the govern-ment changes the number of dollars in circulation. An important piece of thisanalysis, it turns out, is how prices respond. Many prices in the economy changeinfrequently; the newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, are changed onlyevery few years. Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptionswhen studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons. Forstudying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do notchange much. We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that allprices are completely fixed. For studying the long-run effects of the policy, how-ever, we may assume that all prices are completely flexible. Just as a physicist usesdifferent assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling beach balls, econ-omists use different assumptions when studying the short-run and long-run ef-fects of a change in the quantity of money.\\nECONOMIC MODELS\\nHigh school biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the hu-man body. These models have all the major organs—the heart, the liver, the kid-neys, and so on. The models allow teachers to show their students in a simple wayhow the important parts of the body fit together. Of course, these plastic modelsCHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 23\\nare not actual human bodies, and no one would mistake the model for a real per-\\nson. These models are stylized, and they omit many details. Yet despite this lack ofrealism—indeed, because of this lack of realism—studying these models is usefulfor learning how the human body works.\\nEconomists also use models to learn about the world, but instead of being\\nmade of plastic, they are most often composed of diagrams and equations. Likea biology teacher’s plastic model, economic models omit many details to allowus to see what is truly important. Just as the biology teacher’s model does not in-clude all of the body’s muscles and capillaries, an economist’s model does notinclude every feature of the economy.\\nAs we use models to examine various economic issues throughout this book,\\nyou will see that all the models are built with assumptions. Just as a physicist be-gins the analysis of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of friction,economists assume away many of the details of the economy that are irrelevant forstudying the question at hand. All models—in physics, biology, or economics—simplify reality in order to improve our understanding of it.\\nOUR FIRST MODEL: THE CIRCULAR-FLOW DIAGRAM\\nThe economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities—buying,selling, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on. To understand how the econ-omy works, we must find some way to simplify our thinking about all these activ-ities. In other words, we need a model that explains, in general terms, how theeconomy is organized and how participants in the economy interact with oneanother.\\nFigure 2-1 presents a visual model of the economy, called a circular-flow\\ndiagram. In this model, the economy has two types of decisionmakers—house-\\nholds and firms. Firms produce goods and services using inputs, such as labor,land, and capital (buildings and machines). These inputs are called the factors of\\nproduction. Households own the factors of production and consume all the goods\\nand services that the firms produce.\\nHouseholds and firms interact in two types of markets. In the markets for\\ngoods and services, households are buyers and firms are sellers. In particular,\\nhouseholds buy the output of goods and services that firms produce. In the mar-\\nkets for the factors of production, households are sellers and firms are buyers. In\\nthese markets, households provide firms the inputs that the firms use to producegoods and services. The circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizingall the economic transactions that occur between households and firms in theeconomy.\\nThe inner loop of the circular-flow diagram represents the flows of goods and\\nservices between households and firms. The households sell the use of their labor,land, and capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of production. The firmsthen use these factors to produce goods and services, which in turn are soldto households in the markets for goods and services. Hence, the factors of produc-tion flow from households to firms, and goods and services flow from firms tohouseholds.\\nThe outer loop of the circular-flow diagram represents the corresponding flow\\nof dollars. The households spend money to buy goods and services from thefirms. The firms use some of the revenue from these sales to pay for the factors ofcircular-flow diagram\\na visual model of the economy thatshows how dollars flow throughmarkets among households and firms24 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nproduction, such as the wages of their workers. What’s left is the profit of the firm\\nowners, who themselves are members of households. Hence, spending on goodsand services flows from households to firms, and income in the form of wages,rent, and profit flows from firms to households.\\nLet’s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its\\nway from person to person through the economy. Imagine that the dollar begins ata household, sitting in, say, your wallet. If you want to buy a cup of coffee, youtake the dollar to one of the economy’s markets for goods and services, such asyour local Starbucks coffee shop. There you spend it on your favorite drink. Whenthe dollar moves into the Starbucks cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm.The dollar doesn’t stay at Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it tobuy inputs in the markets for the factors of production. For instance, Starbucksmight use the dollar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies or to paythe wages of its workers. In either case, the dollar enters the income of somehousehold and, once again, is back in someone’s wallet. At that point, the story ofthe economy’s circular flow starts once again.\\nThe circular-flow diagram in Figure 2-1 is one simple model of the economy.

Yet these details are not crucial for a basic under-standing of how the economy is organized. Because of its simplicity, thiscircular-flow diagram is useful to keep in mind when thinking about how thepieces of the economy fit together.\\nOUR SECOND MODEL: THE PRODUCTION\\nPOSSIBILITIES FRONTIER\\nMost economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools\\nof mathematics. Here we consider one of the simplest such models, called the pro-duction possibilities frontier, and see how this model illustrates some basic eco-nomic ideas.\\nAlthough real economies produce thousands of goods and services, let’s imag-\\nine an economy that produces only two goods—cars and computers. Together thecar industry and the computer industry use all of the economy’s factors of pro-duction. The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the various\\ncombinations of output—in this case, cars and computers—that the economy canpossibly produce given the available factors of production and the available pro-duction technology that firms can use to turn these factors into output.\\nFigure 2-2 is an example of a production possibilities frontier. In this economy,\\nif all resources were used in the car industry, the economy would produce 1,000cars and no computers. If all resources were used in the computer industry, theeconomy would produce 3,000 computers and no cars. The two end points ofthe production possibilities frontier represent these extreme possibilities.

Points outsidethe frontier are not feasible giventhe economy’s resources.production possibilities\\nfrontiera graph that shows the combinationsof output that the economy canpossibly produce given the availablefactors of production and theavailable production technology26 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\neconomy were to divide its resources between the two industries, it could produce\\n700 cars and 2,000 computers, shown in the figure by point A. By contrast, the out-come at point D is not possible because resources are scarce: The economy doesnot have enough of the factors of production to support that level of output. Inother words, the economy can produce at any point on or inside the productionpossibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points outside the frontier.\\nAn outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from the\\nscarce resources it has available. Points on (rather than inside) the production pos-sibilities frontier represent efficient levels of production. When the economy is pro-ducing at such a point, say point A, there is no way to produce more of one goodwithout producing less of the other. Point B represents an inefficient outcome. For\\nsome reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is producing lessthan it could from the resources it has available: It is producing only 300 cars and1,000 computers. If the source of the inefficiency were eliminated, the economycould move from point B to point A, increasing production of both cars (to 700)and computers (to 2,000).\\nOne of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face\\ntradeoffs. The production possibilities frontier shows one tradeoff that societyfaces. Once we have reached the efficient points on the frontier, the only way ofgetting more of one good is to get less of the other. When the economy moves frompoint A to point C, for instance, society produces more computers but at the ex-pense of producing fewer cars.\\nAnother of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of something is what\\nyou give up to get it. This is called the opportunity cost. The production possibilities\\nfrontier shows the opportunity cost of one good as measured in terms of the othergood. When society reallocates some of the factors of production from the car in-dustry to the computer industry, moving the economy from point A to point C, itgives up 100 cars to get 200 additional computers. In other words, when the econ-omy is at point A, the opportunity cost of 200 computers is 100 cars.\\nNotice that the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2-2 is bowed out-\\nward. This means that the opportunity cost of cars in terms of computers dependson how much of each good the economy is producing. When the economy is usingmost of its resources to make cars, the production possibilities frontier is quitesteep. Because even workers and machines best suited to making computers arebeing used to make cars, the economy gets a substantial increase in the number ofcomputers for each car it gives up. By contrast, when the economy is using most ofits resources to make computers, the production possibilities frontier is quite flat.In this case, the resources best suited to making computers are already in the com-puter industry, and each car the economy gives up yields only a small increase inthe number of computers.\\nThe production possibilities frontier shows the tradeoff between the produc-\\ntion of different goods at a given time, but the tradeoff can change over time. Forexample, if a technological advance in the computer industry raises the number ofcomputers that a worker can produce per week, the economy can make more com-puters for any given number of cars. As a result, the production possibilities fron-tier shifts outward, as in Figure 2-3. Because of this economic growth, societymight move production from point A to point E, enjoying more computers andmore cars.\\nThe production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to high-\\nlight and clarify some basic ideas. We have used it to illustrate some of the\\nCHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 27\\nconcepts mentioned briefly in Chapter 1: scarcity, efficiency, tradeoffs, opportunity\\ncost, and economic growth. As you study economics, these ideas will recur invarious forms. The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of think-ing about them.\\nMICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS\\nMany subjects are studied on various levels. Consider biology, for example. Molec-ular biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things. Cellularbiologists study cells, which are made up of many chemical compounds and, atthe same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms. Evolution-ary biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how specieschange gradually over the centuries.\\nEconomics is also studied on various levels. We can study the decisions of in-\\ndividual households and firms. Or we can study the interaction of households andfirms in markets for specific goods and services. Or we can study the operation ofthe economy as a whole, which is just the sum of the activities of all these decision-makers in all these markets.\\nThe field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields.\\nMicroeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions and\\nhow they interact in specific markets. Macroeconomics is the study of economy-\\nwide phenomena. A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control onhousing in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto in-dustry, or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers’ earnings.

Because\\nchanges in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals,it is impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without consideringthe associated microeconomic decisions. For example, a macroeconomist mightstudy the effect of a cut in the federal income tax on the overall production ofgoods and services. To analyze this issue, he or she must consider how the taxcut affects the decisions of households about how much to spend on goods andservices.\\nDespite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the\\ntwo fields are distinct. In economics, as in biology, it may seem natural to beginwith the smallest unit and build up. Yet doing so is neither necessary nor alwaysthe best way to proceed. Evolutionary biology is, in a sense, built upon molecularbiology, since species are made up of molecules. Yet molecular biology and evolu-tionary biology are separate fields, each with its own questions and its own meth-ods. Similarly, because microeconomics and macroeconomics address differentquestions, they sometimes take quite different approaches and are often taught inseparate courses.\\nQUICK QUIZ: In what sense is economics like a science? NDraw a \\nproduction possibilities frontier for a society that produces food and clothing. \\nShow an efficient point, an inefficient point, and an infeasible point. Show the \\neffects of a drought. NDefine microeconomics and macroeconomics.\\nTHE ECONOMIST AS POLICY ADVISER\\nOften economists are asked to explain the causes of economic events. Why, for ex-\\nample, is unemployment higher for teenagers than for older workers? Sometimeseconomists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic outcomes.What, for instance, should the government do to improve the economic well-beingof teenagers? When economists are trying to explain the world, they are scientists.When they are trying to help improve it, they are policy advisers.\\nPOSITIVE VERSUS NORMATIVE ANALYSIS\\nTo help clarify the two roles that economists play, we begin by examining the useof language. Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they uselanguage in different ways.\\nFor example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws.\\nHere are two statements you might hear:\\nP\\nOLLY : Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.\\nNORMA : The government should raise the minimum wage.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 29\\nIgnoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that Polly and\\nNorma differ in what they are trying to do. Polly is speaking like a scientist: She ismaking a claim about how the world works. Norma is speaking like a policy ad-viser: She is making a claim about how she would like to change the world.\\nIn general, statements about the world are of two types. One type, such as\\nPolly’s, is positive. Positive statements are descriptive. They make a claim about\\nhow the world is.A second type of statement, such as Norma’s, is normative. Nor-\\nmative statements are prescriptive. They make a claim about how the world ought\\nto be.\\nA key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge\\ntheir validity. We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by exam-ining evidence. An economist might evaluate Polly’s statement by analyzing dataon changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time. By con-trast, evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts. Norma’sstatement cannot be judged using data alone. Deciding what is good or bad policyis not merely a matter of science. It also involves our views on ethics, religion, andpolitical philosophy.\\nOf course, positive and normative statements may be related. Our positive\\nviews about how the world works affect our normative views about what policiesare desirable. Polly’s claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment, if true,might lead us to reject Norma’s conclusion that the government should raise theminimum wage. Yet our normative conclusions cannot come from positive analy-sis alone. Instead, they require both positive analysis and value judgments.\\nAs you study economics, keep in mind the distinction between positive and\\nnormative statements. Much of economics just tries to explain how the economyworks. Yet often the goal of economics is to improve how the economy works.When you hear economists making normative statements, you know they havecrossed the line from scientist to policy adviser.\\nECONOMISTS IN WASHINGTON\\nPresident Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist.When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, “On the onehand, . . . . On the other hand, . . . .”\\nTruman was right in realizing that economists’ advice is not always straight-\\nforward. This tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chap-\\nter 1: People face tradeoffs. Economists are aware that tradeoffs are involved inmost policy decisions. A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equity. Itmight help future generations but hurt current generations. An economist whosays that all policy decisions are easy is an economist not to be trusted.\\nTruman was also not alone among presidents in relying on the advice of econ-\\nomists. Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance fromthe Council of Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff ofseveral dozen economists. The council, whose offices are just a few steps from theWhite House, has no duty other than to advise the president and to write the an-nual Economic Report of the President.\\nThe president also receives input from economists in many administrative de-\\npartments. Economists at the Department of Treasury help design tax policy. Econ-omists at the Department of Labor analyze data on workers and those looking forpositive statements\\nclaims that attempt to describe theworld as it is\\nnormative statements\\nclaims that attempt to prescribe howthe world should be\\n30 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nwork in order to help formulate labor-market policies. Economists at the Depart-\\nment of Justice help enforce the nation’s antitrust laws.\\nEconomists are also found outside the administrative branch of government.\\nTo obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the ad-vice of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists. The Fed-eral Reserve, the quasi-governmental institution that sets the nation’s monetarypolicy, employs hundreds of economists to analyze economic developments in theUnited States and throughout the world. Table 2-1 lists the Web sites of some ofthese agencies.\\nThe influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their\\nresearch and writings often affect policy indirectly. Economist John MaynardKeynes offered this observation:\\nThe ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and\\nwhen they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood. Indeed,the world is ruled by little else. Practical men, who believe themselves to be quiteexempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defuncteconomist. Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling theirfrenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.\\n“Let’s switch. I’ll make the policy, you implement it, and he’ll explain it.”\\nTable 2-1\\nWEBSITES.

Indeed, the\\n“academic scribbler” now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Give an example of a positive statement and an example of a \\nnormative statement. NName three parts of government that regularly rely \\non advice from economists.\\nWHY ECONOMISTS DISAGREE\\n“If all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.” This\\nquip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing. Economists as a group are often crit-icized for giving conflicting advice to policymakers. President Ronald Reagan oncejoked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would have100 questions and 3,000 answers.\\nWhy do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policy-\\nmakers? There are two basic reasons:\\nNEconomists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories\\nabout how the world works.\\nNEconomists may have different values and, therefore, different normative\\nviews about what policy should try to accomplish.\\nLet’s discuss each of these reasons.\\nDIFFERENCES IN SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENTS\\nSeveral centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was at the\\ncenter of the solar system. More recently, meteorologists have debated whetherthe earth is experiencing “global warming” and, if so, why. Science is a search forunderstanding about the world around us. It is not surprising that as the searchcontinues, scientists can disagree about the direction in which truth lies.\\nEconomists often disagree for the same reason. Economics is a young science,\\nand there is still much to be learned. Economists sometimes disagree because theyhave different hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the sizeof important parameters.\\nFor example, economists disagree about whether the government should levy\\ntaxes based on a household’s income or its consumption (spending). Advocates ofa switch from the current income tax to a consumption tax believe that the changewould encourage households to save more, because income that is saved wouldnot be taxed. Higher saving, in turn, would lead to more rapid growth in pro-ductivity and living standards. Advocates of the current income tax believe thathousehold saving would not respond much to a change in the tax laws. Thesetwo groups of economists hold different normative views about the tax systembecause they have different positive views about the responsiveness of saving totax incentives.32 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nDIFFERENCES IN VALUES\\nSuppose that Peter and Paul both take the same amount of water from the town\\nwell. To pay for maintaining the well, the town taxes its residents. Peter has in-come of $50,000 and is taxed $5,000, or 10 percent of his income. Paul has incomeof $10,000 and is taxed $2,000, or 20 percent of his income.\\nIs this policy fair? If not, who pays too much and who pays too little? Does it\\nmatter whether Paul’s low income is due to a medical disability or to his decisionto pursue a career in acting? Does it matter whether Peter’s high income is due toa large inheritance or to his willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?\\nThese are difficult questions on which people are likely to disagree. If the town\\nhired two experts to study how the town should tax its residents to pay for thewell, we would not be surprised if they offered conflicting advice.\\nThis simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public\\npolicy. As we learned earlier in our discussion of normative and positive analysis,policies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone. Economists give conflictingadvice sometimes because they have different values. Perfecting the science of eco-nomics will not tell us whether it is Peter or Paul who pays too much.\\nPERCEPTION VERSUS REALITY\\nBecause of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values, some disagreement among economists is inevitable. Yet one should not over-state the amount of disagreement. In many cases, economists do offer a unitedview.\\nTable 2-2 contains ten propositions about economic policy. In a survey of\\neconomists in business, government, and academia, these propositions were en-dorsed by an overwhelming majority of respondents. Most of these propositionswould fail to command a similar consensus among the general public.\\nThe first proposition in the table is about rent control. For reasons we will dis-\\ncuss in Chapter 6, almost all economists believe that rent control adversely affectsthe availability and quality of housing and is a very costly way of helping the mostneedy members of society. Nonetheless, many city governments choose to ignorethe advice of economists and place ceilings on the rents that landlords may chargetheir tenants.\\nThe second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and import quotas. For\\nreasons we will discuss in Chapter 3 and more fully in Chapter 9, almost all econ-omists oppose such barriers to free trade. Nonetheless, over the years, the presi-dent and Congress have chosen to restrict the import of certain goods. In 1993 theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which reduced barriers to tradeamong the United States, Canada, and Mexico, passed Congress, but only by anarrow margin, despite overwhelming support from economists. In this case,economists did offer united advice, but many members of Congress chose to ig-nore it.\\nWhy do policies such as rent control and import quotas persist if the experts\\nare united in their opposition? The reason may be that economists have not yetconvinced the general public that these policies are undesirable. One purpose ofthis book is to make you understand the economist’s view of these and other sub-jects and, perhaps, to persuade you that it is the right one.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 33\\nQUICK QUIZ: Why might economic advisers to the president disagree \\nabout a question of policy?\\nLET’S GET GOING\\nThe first two chapters of this book have introduced you to the ideas and methods\\nof economics.

Often these economic variables are related to one another. When the price ofbananas rises, people buy fewer bananas. One way of expressing the relationshipsamong variables is with graphs.\\nGraphs serve two purposes. First, when developing economic theories, graphs\\noffer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described withequations or words. Second, when analyzing economic data, graphs provide away of finding how variables are in fact related in the world. Whether we areworking with theory or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recog-nizable forest emerges from a multitude of trees.\\nNumerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as a\\nthought can be expressed in words in many ways. A good writer chooses wordsthat will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic. Aneffective economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand.\\nIn this appendix we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathe-\\nmatical relationships among variables. We also discuss some of the pitfalls that canarise in the use of graphical methods.\\nGRAPHS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE\\nThree common graphs are shown in Figure 2A-1. The pie chart in panel (a) shows\\nhow total income in the United States is divided among the sources of income, in-cluding compensation of employees, corporate profits, and so on. A slice of the pierepresents each source’s share of the total. The bar graph in panel (b) compares a\\nmeasure of average income, called real GDP per person, for four countries. Theheight of each bar represents the average income in each country. The time-series\\ngraph in panel (c) traces the rising productivity in the U.S. business sector overtime. The height of the line shows output per hour in each year. You have probablyseen similar graphs presented in newspapers and magazines.\\n36CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 37\\nGRAPHS OF TWO VARIABLES: THE COORDINATE SYSTEM\\nAlthough the three graphs in Figure 2A-1 are useful in showing how a variable\\nchanges over time or across individuals, such graphs are limited in how muchthey can tell us. These graphs display information only on a single variable. Econ-omists are often concerned with the relationships between variables. Thus, theyneed to be able to display two variables on a single graph. The coordinate system\\nmakes this possible.\\nSuppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade\\npoint average. For each student in your class, you could record a pair of numbers:hours per week spent studying and grade point average. These numbers couldthen be placed in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the\\ngraph. Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair (25 hours/week,3.5 GPA), while his “what-me-worry?” classmate Alfred E. is represented by theordered pair (5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA).\\nWe can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid. The first number\\nin each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location of the\\npoint. The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical location of\\nthe point. The point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero is known\\nas the origin. The two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the point is lo-\\ncated in relation to the origin: xunits to the right of the origin and yunits above it.\\nFigure 2A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E.,\\nAlfred E., and their classmates. This type of graph is called a scatterplot because it\\nplots scattered points. Looking at this graph, we immediately notice that pointsfarther to the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicatinga better grade point average). Because study time and grade point average typi-cally move in the same direction, we say that these two variables have a positiveRental \\nincome (2%)Corporate \\nprofits (12%)(a) Pie Chart (c) Time-Series Graph\\nReal GDP per\\nPerson in 1997United \\nStates\\n($28,740)30,000\\n25,00020,00015,00010,000\\n5,000\\n0United \\nKingdom\\n($20,520)(b) Bar Graph\\nMexico\\n($8,120)\\nIndia\\n($1,950)Compensation\\nof employees \\n(72%)Proprietors’ \\nincome (8%)\\nInterest \\nincome (6%)Productivity \\nIndex \\n115\\n95755535\\n0\\n1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000\\nFigure 2A-1TYPESOF GRAPHS .

By contrast, if we were to graph party time and grades, we would likely\\nfind that higher party time is associated with lower grades; because these variablestypically move in opposite directions, we would call this a negative correlation. In\\neither case, the coordinate system makes the correlation between the two variableseasy to see.\\nCURVES IN THE COORDINATE SYSTEM\\nStudents who study more do tend to get higher grades, but other factors also in-fluence a student’s grade. Previous preparation is an important factor, for instance,as are talent, attention from teachers, even eating a good breakfast. A scatterplotlike Figure 2A-2 does not attempt to isolate the effect that study has on gradesfrom the effects of other variables. Often, however, economists prefer looking athow one variable affects another holding everything else constant.\\nTo see how this is done, let’s consider one of the most important graphs in eco-\\nnomics—the demand curve. The demand curve traces out the effect of a good’s price\\non the quantity of the good consumers want to buy. Before showing a demandcurve, however, consider Table 2A-1, which shows how the number of novels thatEmma buys depends on her income and on the price of novels. When novels arecheap, Emma buys them in large quantities. As they become more expensive, sheborrows books from the library instead of buying them or chooses to go to themovies instead of reading. Similarly, at any given price, Emma buys more novelswhen she has a higher income. That is, when her income increases, she spends partof the additional income on novels and part on other goods.\\nWe now have three variables—the price of novels, income, and the number of\\nnovels purchased—which is more than we can represent in two dimensions.

Be-cause the demand curve represents the relationship between price and quantitydemanded, we hold Emma’s income constant and show how the number of nov-els she buys varies with the price of novels.\\nSuppose that Emma’s income is $30,000 per year. If we place the number of\\nnovels Emma purchases on the x-axis and the price of novels on the y-axis, we canTable 2A-1\\nNOVELS PURCHASED BY EMMA .\\nThis table shows the number ofnovels Emma buys at variousincomes and prices. For anygiven level of income, the data onprice and quantity demanded canbe graphed to produce Emma’sdemand curve for novels, as inFigure 2A-3.INCOME\\nPRICE $20,000 $30,000 $40,000\\n$10 2 novels 5 novels 8 novels\\n96 9 1 281 0 1 3 1 671 4 1 7 2 061 8 2 1 2 452 2 2 5 2 8\\nDemand Demand Demand \\ncurve, D\\n3 curve, D1 curve, D2\\nPrice of\\nNovels\\n5\\n4321\\n30 Quantity\\nof Novels\\nPurchased678910$11\\n0 5 10 15 20 25Demand, D1(5, $10)\\n(9, $9)\\n(13, $8)\\n(17, $7)\\n(21, $6)\\n(25, $5)Figure 2A-3\\nDEMAND CURVE . The line D1\\nshows how Emma’s purchases of\\nnovels depend on the price ofnovels when her income is heldconstant. Because the price andthe quantity demanded arenegatively related, the demandcurve slopes downward.40 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\ngraphically represent the middle column of Table 2A-1. When the points that rep-\\nresent these entries from the table—(5 novels, $10), (9 novels, $9), and so on—areconnected, they form a line. This line, pictured in Figure 2A-3, is known as Emma’sdemand curve for novels; it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at anygiven price. The demand curve is downward sloping, indicating that a higherprice reduces the quantity of novels demanded. Because the quantity of novelsdemanded and the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two vari-ables are negatively related. (Conversely, when two variables move in the same di-\\nrection, the curve relating them is upward sloping, and we say the variables arepositively related. )\\nNow suppose that Emma’s income rises to $40,000 per year. At any given\\nprice, Emma will purchase more novels than she did at her previous level of in-come. Just as earlier we drew Emma’s demand curve for novels using the entriesfrom the middle column of Table 2A-1, we now draw a new demand curve usingthe entries from the right-hand column of the table. This new demand curve(curve D\\n2) is pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) in Figure 2A-4; the new\\ncurve is a similar line drawn farther to the right. We therefore say that Emma’s de-mand curve for novels shifts to the right when her income increases. Likewise, if\\nEmma’s income were to fall to $20,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at anygiven price and her demand curve would shift to the left (to curve D\\n3).\\nIn economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve\\nand shifts of a curve. As we can see from Figure 2A-3, if Emma earns $30,000 per\\nyear and novels cost $8 apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year. If the price ofnovels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year. Thedemand curve, however, stays fixed in the same place. Emma still buys the same\\nPrice of\\nNovels\\n5\\n4321\\n30 Quantity\\nof Novels\\nPurchased678910$11\\n0 5 13 16 10 15 20 25(13, $8)\\n(16, $8)\\nD3\\n(income =\\n$20,000)D1\\n(income =\\n$30,000)D2 (income =\\n$40,000)(10, $8)When income increases,\\nthe demand curveshifts to the right.\\nWhen incomedecreases, thedemand curveshifts to the left.Figure 2A-4\\nSHIFTING DEMAND CURVES .\\nThe location of Emma’s demandcurve for novels depends on howmuch income she earns. Themore she earns, the more novelsshe will purchase at any givenprice, and the farther to the righther demand curve will lie.Curve D\\n1represents Emma’s\\noriginal demand curve when herincome is $30,000 per year.

By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 buther income rises to $40,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16per year. Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts\\nout, as shown in Figure 2A-4.\\nThere is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve. When a vari-\\nable that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts. Income is on neitherthe x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma’s income changes, her de-\\nmand curve must shift. Any change that affects Emma’s purchasing habits besidesa change in the price of novels will result in a shift in her demand curve. If, for in-stance, the public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants toread, she will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will shiftto the right. Or, if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time at themovies and less time reading, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and herdemand curve will shift to the left. By contrast, when a variable on an axis of thegraph changes, the curve does not shift. We read the change as a movement alongthe curve.\\nSLOPE\\nOne question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchasinghabits respond to price. Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure 2A-5. If thiscurve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels regardless\\nPrice of\\nNovels\\n5\\n4321\\n30 Quantity\\nof Novels\\nPurchased678910$11\\n05 2 1 13 10 15 20 25Demand,  D1(13, $8)\\n(21, $6)6 /H11002 8 /H11005 /H110022\\n21 /H11002 13 /H11005 8Figure 2A-5\\nCALCULATING THE SLOPE OF A\\nLINE. To calculate the slope of\\nthe demand curve, we can lookat the changes in the x- and\\ny-coordinates as we move from\\nthe point (21 novels, $6) to thepoint (13 novels, $8). The slope ofthe line is the ratio of the changein the y-coordinate ( /H110022) to the\\nchange in the x-coordinate ( /H110018),\\nwhich equals /H110021/4.42 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nof whether they are cheap or expensive. If this curve is much flatter, Emma pur-\\nchases many fewer novels when the price rises. To answer questions about howmuch one variable responds to changes in another variable, we can use the con-cept of slope.\\nThe slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal\\ndistance covered as we move along the line. This definition is usually written outin mathematical symbols as follows:\\nslope = ,\\nwhere the Greek letter ∆(delta) stands for the change in a variable. In other words,\\nthe slope of a line is equal to the “rise” (change in y) divided by the “run” (change\\nin x). The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat upward-sloping line,\\na large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, and a negative numberfor a downward-sloping line. A horizontal line has a slope of zero because inthis case the y-variable never changes; a vertical line is defined to have an infinite\\nslope because the y-variable can take any value without the x-variable changing\\nat all.\\nWhat is the slope of Emma’s demand curve for novels? First of all, because the\\ncurve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative. To calculate a numericalvalue for the slope, we must choose two points on the line. With Emma’s incomeat $30,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of $8.When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the change betweenthese two points; in other words, we are concerned with the difference betweenthem, which lets us know that we will have to subtract one set of values from theother, as follows:\\nslope = = = = = .\\nFigure 2A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works. Try computing the\\nslope of Emma’s demand curve using two different points. You should get exactlythe same result, /H110021/4. One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same\\nslope everywhere. This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper insome places than in others.\\nThe slope of Emma’s demand curve tells us something about how responsive\\nher purchases are to changes in the price. A small slope (a number close to zero)means that Emma’s demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts thenumber of novels she buys substantially in response to a price change. A largerslope (a number farther from zero) means that Emma’s demand curve is relativelysteep; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly in re-sponse to a price change.\\nCAUSE AND EFFECT\\nEconomists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economyworks. In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of eventscauses another set of events. With a graph like the demand curve, there is no\\ndoubt about cause and effect. Because we are varying price and holding all other/H110021\\n4/H110022\\n86/H110028\\n21/H1100213first y-coordinate /H11002second y-coordinate\\nfirst x-coordinate /H11002second x-coordinate/H9004y\\n/H9004x/H9004y\\n/H9004xCHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST 43\\nvariables constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in\\nthe quantity Emma demands. Remember, however, that our demand curve camefrom a hypothetical example. When graphing data from the real world, it is oftenmore difficult to establish how one variable affects another.\\nThe first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when\\nmeasuring how one variable affects another. If we are not able to hold variablesconstant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing changes in theother variable when actually those changes are caused by a third omitted variable\\nnot pictured on the graph. Even if we have identified the correct two variables tolook at, we might run into a second problem— reverse causality. In other words, we\\nmight decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A. The omitted-variable andreverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution when using graphs todraw conclusions about causes and effects.\\nOmitted Variables To see how omitting a variable can lead to a decep-\\ntive graph, let’s consider an example. Imagine that the government, spurred bypublic concern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions an ex-haustive study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examinesmany of the items found in people’s homes to see which of them are associatedwith the risk of cancer. Big Brother reports a strong relationship between two vari-ables: the number of cigarette lighters that a household owns and the prob-ability that someone in the household will develop cancer. Figure 2A-6 shows thisrelationship.\\nWhat should we make of this result? Big Brother advises a quick policy re-\\nsponse. It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of cigarettelighters by taxing their sale. It also recommends that the government requirewarning labels: “Big Brother has determined that this lighter is dangerous to yourhealth.”\\nIn judging the validity of Big Brother’s analysis, one question is paramount:\\nHas Big Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under con-sideration? If the answer is no, the results are suspect. An easy explanation for Fig-ure 2A-6 is that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to smokecigarettes and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer. If Figure 2A-6 does not\\nRisk of\\nCancer\\nNumber of Lighters in House0Figure 2A-6\\nGRAPH WITH AN OMITTED\\nVARIABLE . The upward-sloping\\ncurve shows that members ofhouseholds with more cigarettelighters are more likely todevelop cancer. Yet we shouldnot conclude that ownership oflighters causes cancer because thegraph does not take into accountthe number of cigarettes smoked.44 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nhold constant the amount of smoking, it does not tell us the true effect of owning\\na cigarette lighter.\\nThis story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph being used\\nto support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether themovements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see.\\nReverse Causality Economists can also make mistakes about causality\\nby misreading its direction. To see how this is possible, suppose the Associationof American Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrivesat Figure 2A-7, which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand peoplein major cities against the number of police officers per thousand people. The an-archists note the curve’s upward slope and argue that because police increaserather than decrease the amount of urban violence, law enforcement should beabolished.\\nIf we could run a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of re-\\nverse causality. To run an experiment, we would set the number of police officersin different cities randomly and then examine the correlation between police andcrime. Figure 2A-7, however, is not based on such an experiment. We simply ob-serve that more dangerous cities have more police officers. The explanation for thismay be that more dangerous cities hire more police. In other words, rather thanpolice causing crime, crime may cause police. Nothing in the graph itself allows usto establish the direction of causality.\\nIt might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to\\nexamine which variable moves first. If we see crime increase and then the policeforce expand, we reach one conclusion. If we see the police force expand and thencrime increase, we reach the other. Yet there is also a flaw with this approach:Often people change their behavior not in response to a change in their presentconditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions.\\nA city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might well hiremore police now. This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and mini-vans. Couples often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child.

Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lightersdon’t cause cancer (omitted variable) and minivans don’t cause larger fam-ilies (reverse causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economicarguments.IN THIS CHAPTER\\nYOU WILL . . .\\nSee how comparative\\nadvantage explains\\nthe gains from tradeConsider how\\neveryone can benefit\\nwhen people trade\\nwith one another\\nLearn the meaning of\\nabsolute advantage\\nand comparative\\nadvantage\\nApply the theory of\\ncomparative\\nadvantage to\\neveryday life and\\nnational policyConsider your typical day.

Nor is some government agency directing them to make what youINTERDEPENDENCE AND THE\\nGAINS FROM TRADE\\n4748 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nwant and to give it to you. Instead, people provide you and other consumers with\\nthe goods and services they produce because they get something in return.\\nIn subsequent chapters we will examine how our economy coordinates the ac-\\ntivities of millions of people with varying tastes and abilities. As a starting pointfor this analysis, here we consider the reasons for economic interdependence. Oneof the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make\\neveryone better off. This principle explains why people trade with their neighborsand why nations trade with other nations. In this chapter we examine this princi-ple more closely. What exactly do people gain when they trade with one another?Why do people choose to become interdependent?\\nA PARABLE FOR THE MODERN ECONOMY\\nTo understand why people choose to depend on others for goods and services andhow this choice improves their lives, let’s look at a simple economy. Imagine thatthere are two goods in the world—meat and potatoes. And there are two people inthe world—a cattle rancher and a potato farmer—each of whom would like to eatboth meat and potatoes.\\nThe gains from trade are most obvious if the rancher can produce only meat\\nand the farmer can produce only potatoes. In one scenario, the rancher and thefarmer could choose to have nothing to do with each other. But after severalmonths of eating beef roasted, boiled, broiled, and grilled, the rancher might de-cide that self-sufficiency is not all it’s cracked up to be. The farmer, who has beeneating potatoes mashed, fried, baked, and scalloped, would likely agree. It is easyto see that trade would allow them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then havea hamburger with french fries.\\nAlthough this scene illustrates most simply how everyone can benefit from\\ntrade, the gains would be similar if the rancher and the farmer were each capableof producing the other good, but only at great cost. Suppose, for example, that thepotato farmer is able to raise cattle and produce meat, but that he is not very goodat it. Similarly, suppose that the cattle rancher is able to grow potatoes, but that herland is not very well suited for it. In this case, it is easy to see that the farmer andthe rancher can each benefit by specializing in what he or she does best and thentrading with the other.\\nThe gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at\\nproducing every good. For example, suppose that the rancher is better at raising\\ncattle and better at growing potatoes than the farmer. In this case, should the\\nrancher or farmer choose to remain self-sufficient? Or is there still reason for themto trade with each other? To answer this question, we need to look more closely atthe factors that affect such a decision.\\nPRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES\\nSuppose that the farmer and the rancher each work 40 hours a week and can de-vote this time to growing potatoes, raising cattle, or a combination of the two.Table 3-1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 1 pound of\\nCHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 49\\nTable 3-1\\nTHEPRODUCTION\\nOPPORTUNITIES OF THE\\nFARMER AND THE RANCHERHOURS NEEDED TO AMOUNT PRODUCED\\nMAKE1 POUND OF : IN40 H OURS\\nMEAT POTATOES MEAT POTATOES\\nFARMER 20 hours/lb 10 hours/lb 2 lbs 4 lbs\\nRANCHER 1 hour/lb 8 hours/lb 40 lbs 5 lbs\\n12\\nPotatoes (pounds) 24A\\n0Meat (pounds)(a) The Farmer’s Production Possibilities Frontier\\n20\\nPotatoes (pounds) 2 1/2B\\n0Meat (pounds)(b) The Rancher’s Production Possibilities Frontier\\n540Figure 3-1\\nTHEPRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES\\nFRONTIER .

The farmer can produce a pound of potatoes in 10 hours and a pound\\nof meat in 20 hours. The rancher, who is more productive in both activities, canproduce a pound of potatoes in 8 hours and a pound of meat in 1 hour.\\nPanel (a) of Figure 3-1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that the\\nfarmer can produce. If the farmer devotes all 40 hours of his time to potatoes, heproduces 4 pounds of potatoes and no meat. If he devotes all his time to meat, heproduces 2 pounds of meat and no potatoes. If the farmer divides his time equallybetween the two activities, spending 20 hours on each, he produces 2 pounds ofpotatoes and 1 pound of meat. The figure shows these three possible outcomes andall others in between.\\nThis graph is the farmer’s production possibilities frontier. As we discussed in\\nChapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the various mixes of outputthat an economy can produce. It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics in\\nChapter 1: People face tradeoffs. Here the farmer faces a tradeoff between produc-ing meat and producing potatoes. You may recall that the production possibilitiesfrontier in Chapter 2 was drawn bowed out; in this case, the tradeoff between thetwo goods depends on the amounts being produced. Here, however, the farmer’stechnology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in Table 3-1) allowshim to switch between one good and the other at a constant rate. In this case, theproduction possibilities frontier is a straight line.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 3-1 shows the production possibilities frontier for the\\nrancher. If the rancher devotes all 40 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 5pounds of potatoes and no meat. If she devotes all her time to meat, she produces40 pounds of meat and no potatoes. If the rancher divides her time equally, spend-ing 20 hours on each activity, she produces 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes and 20pounds of meat. Once again, the production possibilities frontier shows all thepossible outcomes.\\nIf the farmer and rancher choose to be self-sufficient, rather than trade with\\neach other, then each consumes exactly what he or she produces. In this case, theproduction possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier. Thatis, without trade, Figure 3-1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoesthat the farmer and rancher can each consume.\\nAlthough these production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the\\ntradeoffs that the farmer and rancher face, they do not tell us what the farmer andrancher will actually choose to do. To determine their choices, we need to knowthe tastes of the farmer and the rancher. Let’s suppose they choose the combina-tions identified by points A and B in Figure 3-1: The farmer produces and con-sumes 2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat, while the rancher produces andconsumes 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes and 20 pounds of meat.\\nSPECIALIZATION AND TRADE\\nAfter several years of eating combination B, the rancher gets an idea and goes totalk to the farmer:\\nR\\nANCHER : Farmer, my friend, have I got a deal for you! I know how to improve\\nlife for both of us. I think you should stop producing meat altogetherand devote all your time to growing potatoes. According to mycalculations, if you work 40 hours a week growing potatoes, you’ll\\nCHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 51\\nproduce 4 pounds of potatoes. If you give me 1 of those 4 pounds,\\nI’ll give you 3 pounds of meat in return. In the end, you’ll get to eat 3pounds of potatoes and 3 pounds of meat every week, instead of the2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat you now get. If you goalong with my plan, you’ll have more of both foods.

How can this deal make us both better off?\\nRANCHER : We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in\\ndoing what we do best. You will spend more time growing potatoesand less time raising cattle. I will spend more time raising cattle andless time growing potatoes. As a result of specialization and trade,each of us can consume both more meat and more potatoes withoutworking any more hours.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw an example of a production possibilities frontier for\\nRobinson Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gatheringcoconuts and catching fish.

The farmer doesn’t seem to doTable 3-2THEOUTCOME THEOUTCOME THEGAINS\\nWITHOUT TRADE : WITH TRADE : FROM TRADE :\\nWHAT THEYPRODUCE WHAT THEY WHAT THEY WHAT THEY THEINCREASE IN\\nAND CONSUME PRODUCE TRADE CONSUME CONSUMPTION\\nFARMER 1 lb meat 0 lbs meat Gets 3 lbs meat 3 lbs meat 2 lbs meat\\n2 lbs potatoes 4 lbs potatoes for 1 lb potatoes 3 lbs potatoes 1 lb potatoes\\nRANCHER 20 lbs meat 24 lbs meat Gives 3 lbs meat 21 lbs meat 1 lb meat\\n2 1/2 lbs potatoes 2 lbs potatoes for 1 lb potatoes 3 lbs potatoes 1/2 lb potatoes\\nTHEGAINS FROM TRADE : A S UMMARY}point A }point A* }A* –A\\n}point B }point B* }B* – BCHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 53\\nanything best. To solve this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative\\nadvantage.\\nAs a first step in developing this principle, consider the following question: In\\nour example, who can produce potatoes at lower cost—the farmer or the rancher?There are two possible answers, and in these two answers lie both the solution toour puzzle and the key to understanding the gains from trade.\\nABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE\\nOne way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to com-pare the inputs required by the two producers. The rancher needs only 8 hours toproduce a pound of potatoes, whereas the farmer needs 10 hours. Based on this in-formation, one might conclude that the rancher has the lower cost of producingpotatoes.\\nEconomists use the term absolute advantage when comparing the productiv-\\nity of one person, firm, or nation to that of another. The producer that requires asmaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said to have an absolute advantagein producing that good. In our example, the rancher has an absolute advantageboth in producing potatoes and in producing meat, because she requires less timethan the farmer to produce a unit of either good.\\nOPPORTUNITY COST AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE\\nThere is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes. Rather than com-paring inputs required, we can compare the opportunity costs. Recall from Chap-ter 1 that the opportunity cost of some item is what we give up to get that item. In\\nour example, we assumed that the farmer and the rancher each spend 40 hours aweek working. Time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away from timeavailable for producing meat. As the rancher and farmer change their allocationsof time between producing the two goods, they move along their production pos-sibility frontiers; in a sense, they are using one good to produce the other. The op-portunity cost measures the tradeoff that each of them faces.\\nLet’s first consider the rancher’s opportunity cost. Producing 1 pound of pota-\\ntoes takes her 8 hours of work. When the rancher spends that 8 hours producingpotatoes, she spends 8 hours less producing meat. Because the rancher needs only1 hour to produce 1 pound of meat, 8 hours of work would yield 8 pounds of meat.Hence, the rancher’s opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes is 8 pounds of meat.\\nNow consider the farmer’s opportunity cost. Producing 1 pound of potatoes\\ntakes him 10 hours. Because he needs 20 hours to produce 1 pound of meat, 10hours would yield 1/2 pound of meat. Hence, the farmer’s opportunity cost of 1pound of potatoes is 1/2 pound of meat.\\nTable 3-3 shows the opportunity cost of meat and potatoes for the two pro-\\nducers. Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunitycost of potatoes. Because 1 pound of potatoes costs the rancher 8 pounds of meat,1 pound of meat costs the rancher 1/8 pound of potatoes. Similarly, because 1pound of potatoes costs the farmer 1/2 pound of meat, 1 pound of meat costs thefarmer 2 pounds of potatoes.\\nEconomists use the term comparative advantage when describing the oppor-\\ntunity cost of two producers. The producer who has the smaller opportunity costabsolute advantage\\nthe comparison among producers of agood according to their productivity\\nopportunity cost\\nwhatever must be given up to obtainsome item\\ncomparative advantage\\nthe comparison among producersof a good according to theiropportunity cost54 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nof producing a good—that is, who has to give up less of other goods to produce\\nit—is said to have a comparative advantage in producing that good. In our exam-ple, the farmer has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than therancher (1/2 pound versus 8 pounds of meat). The rancher has a lower opportu-nity cost of producing meat than the farmer (1/8 pound versus 2 pounds of pota-toes). Thus, the farmer has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and therancher has a comparative advantage in producing meat.\\nNotice that it would be impossible for the same person to have a comparative\\nadvantage in both goods. Because the opportunity cost of one good is the inverseof the opportunity cost of the other, if a person’s opportunity cost of one good isrelatively high, his opportunity cost of the other good must be relatively low. Com-parative advantage reflects the relative opportunity cost. Unless two people haveexactly the same opportunity cost, one person will have a comparative advantagein one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage in the othergood.\\nCOMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND TRADE\\nDifferences in opportunity cost and comparative advantage create the gains fromtrade. When each person specializes in producing the good for which he or she hasa comparative advantage, total production in the economy rises, and this increasein the size of the economic pie can be used to make everyone better off. In otherwords, as long as two people have different opportunity costs, each can benefitfrom trade by obtaining a good at a price lower than his or her opportunity cost ofthat good.\\nConsider the proposed deal from the viewpoint of the farmer. The farmer gets\\n3 pounds of meat in exchange for 1 pound of potatoes. In other words, the farmerbuys each pound of meat for a price of 1/3 pound of potatoes. This price of meatis lower than his opportunity cost for 1 pound of meat, which is 2 pounds of pota-toes. Thus, the farmer benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a goodprice.\\nNow consider the deal from the rancher’s viewpoint. The rancher buys 1\\npound of potatoes for a price of 3 pounds of meat. This price of potatoes is lowerthan her opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes, which is 8 pounds of meat. Thus,the rancher benefits because she gets to buy potatoes at a good price.\\nThese benefits arise because each person concentrates on the activity for which\\nhe or she has the lower opportunity cost: The farmer spends more time growingpotatoes, and the rancher spends more time producing meat. As a result, the totalproduction of potatoes and the total production of meat both rise, and the farmerTable 3-3\\nTHEOPPORTUNITY COST OF\\nMEAT AND POTATOESOPPORTUNITY COST OF :\\n1 POUND OF MEAT 1 POUND OF POTATOES\\nFARMER 2 lbs potatoes 1/2 lb meat\\nRANCHER 1/8 lb potatoes 8 lbs meatCHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 55\\nand rancher share the benefits of this increased production. The moral of the story\\nof the farmer and the rancher should now be clear: Trade can benefit everyone in so-\\nciety because it allows people to specialize in activities in which they have a comparativeadvantage.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Robinson Crusoe can gather 10 coconuts or catch 1 fish per\\nhour.

Who has a comparative advantage incatching fish?\\nAPPLICATIONS OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE\\nThe principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gainsfrom trade. Because interdependence is so prevalent in the modern world, theprinciple of comparative advantage has many applications. Here are two exam-ples, one fanciful and one of great practical importance.\\nEconomists have long under-\\nstood the principle of compara-tive advantage. Here is how thegreat economist Adam Smithput the argument:\\nIt is a maxim of every\\nprudent master of a family,never to attempt to makeat home what it will costhim more to make than tobuy. The tailor does notattempt to make his own\\nshoes, but buys them of the shoemaker. The shoemakerdoes not attempt to make his own clothes but employs atailor. The farmer attempts to make neither the one northe other, but employs those different artificers. All ofthem find it for their interest to employ their wholeindustry in a way in which they have some advantage overtheir neighbors, and to purchase with a part of itsproduce, or what is the same thing, with the price of partof it, whatever else they have occasion for.\\nThis quotation is from Smith’s 1776 book, An Inquiry into\\nthe Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, which wasa landmark in the analysis of trade\\nand economic interdependence.\\nSmith’s book inspired David\\nRicardo, a millionaire stockbroker,to become an economist. In his1817 book, Principles of Political\\nEconomy and Taxation, Ricardo de-\\nveloped the principle of compara-tive advantage as we know it today.His defense of free trade was not amere academic exercise. Ricardoput his economic beliefs to work asa member of the British Parliament,where he opposed the Corn Laws,which restricted the import of grain.\\nThe conclusions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on\\nthe gains from trade have held up well over time. Althougheconomists often disagree on questions of policy, they areunited in their support of free trade. Moreover, the centralargument for free trade has not changed much in the pasttwo centuries. Even though the field of economics hasbroadened its scope and refined its theories since the timeof Smith and Ricardo, economists’ opposition to trade re-strictions is still based largely on the principle of compara-tive advantage.\\nDAVIDRICARDO\\nFYI\\nThe Legacy of\\nAdam Smith\\nand David\\nRicardo56 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nSHOULD TIGER WOODS MOW HIS OWN LAWN?\\nTiger Woods spends a lot of time walking around on grass. One of the most tal-\\nented golfers of all time, he can hit a drive and sink a putt in a way that most ca-sual golfers only dream of doing. Most likely, he is talented at other activities too.For example, let’s imagine that Woods can mow his lawn faster than anyone else.But just because he canmow his lawn fast, does this mean he should?\\nTo answer this question, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and com-\\nparative advantage. Let’s say that Woods can mow his lawn in 2 hours. In that same2 hours, he could film a television commercial for Nike and earn $10,000. By con-trast, Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Woods’s lawn in 4 hours. In thatsame 4 hours, he could work at McDonald’s and earn $20.\\nIn this example, Woods’s opportunity cost of mowing the lawn is $10,000 and\\nForrest’s opportunity cost is $20. Woods has an absolute advantage in mowinglawns because he can do the work in less time. Yet Forrest has a comparative ad-vantage in mowing lawns because he has the lower opportunity cost.\\nA COMMON BARRIER TO FREE TRADE\\namong countries is tariffs, which are\\ntaxes on the import of goods fromabroad. In the following opinion col-umn, economist Douglas Irwin dis-cusses a recent example of their use.\\nLamb Tariffs Fleece\\nU.S. Consumers\\nBYDOUGLAS A. IRWIN\\nPresident Clinton dealt a serious blow to\\nfree trade last Wednesday, when he an-nounced that the U.S. would impose stiffimport tariffs on lamb from Australia andNew Zealand. His decision undercutsAmerican leadership and makes a mock-\\nery of the administration’s claims that itfavors free and fair trade.\\nU.S. sheep producers have long\\nbeen dependent on government. Formore than half a century, until Congressenacted farm-policy reforms in 1995,they received subsidies for wool. Havinglost that handout, saddled with highcosts and inefficiencies, and facing do-mestic competition from chicken, beef,and pork, sheep producers sought tostop foreign competition by filing for im-port relief.\\nAlmost all U.S. lamb imports come\\nfrom Australia and New Zealand, majoragricultural producers with a crushingcomparative advantage. New Zealandhas fewer than four million people but asmany as 60 million sheep (comparedwith about seven million sheep in theU.S.). New Zealand’s farmers have in-vested substantial resources in newtechnology and effective marketing,making them among the most efficientproducers in the world. New Zealandalso eliminated domestic agriculturalsubsidies in the free-market reforms of\\nthe 1950s, and is a free-trading country,on track to eliminate all import tariffs by2006.\\nRather than emulate this example,\\nthe American Sheep Industry Asso-ciation, among others, filed an “escapeclause” petition under the Trade Actof 1974, which allows temporary“breathing space” protection to import-competing industries. Under the escape-clause provision, a petitioning industry isrequired to present an adjustment planto ensure that it undertakes steps to be-come competitive in the future. The tariffprotection is usually limited and sched-uled to be phased out.\\nThe U.S. International Trade Com-\\nmission determines whether imports area cause of “serious injury” to the do-mestic industry and, if so, proposes aremedy, which the president has full dis-cretion to adopt, change or reject. InFebruary, the ITC did not find that the do-mestic industry had suffered “serious in-jury,” but rather adopted the weakerruling that imports were “a substantial\\nIN THE NEWS\\nWho has a Comparative\\nAdvantage in\\nProducing Lamb?CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 57\\nThe gains from trade in this example are tremendous. Rather than mowing his\\nown lawn, Woods should make the commercial and hire Forrest to mow the lawn.As long as Woods pays Forrest more than $20 and less than $10,000, both of themare better off.\\nSHOULD THE UNITED STATES TRADE\\nWITH OTHER COUNTRIES?\\nJust as individuals can benefit from specialization and trade with one another, as\\nthe farmer and rancher did, so can populations of people in different countries.Many of the goods that Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and many of thegoods produced in the United States are sold abroad. Goods produced abroad andsold domestically are called imports.

Australia and New Zealand evenoffered financial assistance to the U.S.producers, and the administration de-layed any announcement and appearedto be working toward a compromise. Butthese hopes were completely dashedwith the shocking final decision, in whichthe administration capitulated to the de-mands of the sheep industry and its ad-vocates in Congress.\\nThe congressional charge was led\\nby Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), amember of the Agriculture Committeewhose sister, a sheep producer, had ap-peared before the ITC to press for highertariffs. The administration opted for . . .[the following:] On top of existing tariffs,the president imposed a 9% tariff on \\nall\\nimports in the first year (declining to 6%and then 3% in years two and three), anda whopping 40% tariff on imports above\\nlast year’s levels (dropping to 32% and24%). . . .\\nThe American Sheep Industry Asso-\\nciation’s president happily announcedthat the move will “bring some stabilityto the market.” Whenever producersspeak of bringing stability to the market,you know that consumers are gettingfleeced.\\nThe lamb decision, while little no-\\nticed at home, has been closely followedabroad. The decision undercuts the ad-ministration’s free-trade rhetoric andharms its efforts to get other countriesto open up their markets. Some importrelief had been expected, but not soclearly protectionist as what finally mate-rialized. The extreme decision has out-raged farmers in Australia and NewZealand, and officials there have vowedto take the U.S. to a WTO dispute set-tlement panel.\\nThe administration’s timing could\\nnot have been worse. The decision cameright after an Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit reaffirmed its commit-ment to reduce trade barriers, and a few\\nmonths before the World Trade Organi-zation’s November meeting in Seattle,where the WTO is to launch a new roundof multilateral trade negotiations. A prin-cipal U.S. objective at the summit is thereduction of agricultural protection in Eu-rope and elsewhere.\\nIn 1947, facing an election the next\\nyear, President Truman courageously re-sisted special interest pressure and ve-toed a bill to impose import quotas onwool, which would have jeopardized thefirst postwar multilateral trade negotia-tions due to start later that year. In con-trast, Mr. Clinton, though a lame duck,caved in to political pressure. If the U.S.,whose booming economy is the envy ofthe world, cannot resist protectionism,how can it expect other countries todo so?\\nSOURCE :The Wall Street Journal, July 12, 1999,\\np. A28.imports\\ngoods produced abroad and solddomestically\\nexports\\ngoods produced domestically andsold abroad58 PART ONE INTRODUCTION\\nTo see how countries can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries,\\nthe United States and Japan, and two goods, food and cars. Imagine that the twocountries produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese workercan each produce 1 car per month. By contrast, because the United States has moreand better land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 2 tons offood per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of food permonth.\\nThe principle of comparative advantage states that each good should be pro-\\nduced by the country that has the smaller opportunity cost of producing thatgood. Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United Statesbut only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in producingcars. Japan should produce more cars than it wants for its own use and exportsome of them to the United States. Similarly, because the opportunity cost of a tonof food is 1 car in Japan but only 1/2 car in the United States, the United States hasa comparative advantage in producing food. The United States should producemore food than it wants to consume and export some of it to Japan. Through spe-cialization and trade, both countries can have more food and more cars.\\nIn reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among nations are more com-\\nplex than this example suggests, as we will see in Chapter 9. Most importantamong these issues is that each country has many citizens with different interests.International trade can make some individuals worse off, even as it makesthe country as a whole better off. When the United States exports food and im-ports cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the impact on anAmerican autoworker. Yet, contrary to the opinions sometimes voiced by politi-cians and political commentators, international trade is not like war, in whichsome countries win and others lose. Trade allows all countries to achieve greaterprosperity.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Suppose that the world’s fastest typist happens to be \\ntrained in brain surgery. Should he do his own typing or hire a secretary? \\nExplain.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe principle of comparative advantage shows that trade can make everyone bet-\\nter off. You should now understand more fully the benefits of living in an interde-pendent economy. But having seen why interdependence is desirable, you mightnaturally ask how it is possible. How do free societies coordinate the diverse ac-tivities of all the people involved in their economies? What ensures that goods andservices will get from those who should be producing them to those who shouldbe consuming them?\\nIn a world with only two people, such as the rancher and the farmer, the an-\\nswer is simple: These two people can directly bargain and allocate resources be-tween themselves. In the real world with billions of people, the answer is lessobvious. We take up this issue in the next chapter, where we see that free societiesallocate resources through the market forces of supply and demand.CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE 59\\nN Each person consumes goods and services produced by\\nmany other people both in our country and around theworld. Interdependence and trade are desirable becausethey allow everyone to enjoy a greater quantity andvariety of goods and services.\\nN There are two ways to compare the ability of two people\\nin producing a good. The person who can produce thegood with the smaller quantity of inputs is said to havean absolute advantage in producing the good. The person\\nwho has the smaller opportunity cost of producing thegood is said to have a comparative advantage. The gainsfrom trade are based on comparative advantage, not\\nabsolute advantage.\\nN Trade makes everyone better off because it allows\\npeople to specialize in those activities in which theyhave a comparative advantage.\\nN The principle of comparative advantage applies to\\ncountries as well as to people.

They all show theworkings of supply and demand.\\nSupply and demand are the two words that economists use most often—and for\\ngood reason. Supply and demand are the forces that make market economieswork. They determine the quantity of each good produced and the price at whichit is sold. If you want to know how any event or policy will affect the economy,you must think first about how it will affect supply and demand.\\nThis chapter introduces the theory of supply and demand. It considers how\\nbuyers and sellers behave and how they interact with one another. It shows howTHE MARKET FORCES OF\\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND\\n6566 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nsupply and demand determine prices in a market economy and how prices, in\\nturn, allocate the economy’s scarce resources.\\nMARKETS AND COMPETITION\\nThe terms supply and demand refer to the behavior of people as they interact with\\none another in markets. A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a particular\\ngood or service. The buyers as a group determine the demand for the product, andthe sellers as a group determine the supply of the product. Before discussing howbuyers and sellers behave, let’s first consider more fully what we mean by a “mar-ket” and the various types of markets we observe in the economy.\\nCOMPETITIVE MARKETS\\nMarkets take many forms. Sometimes markets are highly organized, such as themarkets for many agricultural commodities. In these markets, buyers and sellersmeet at a specific time and place, where an auctioneer helps set prices and arrangesales.\\nMore often, markets are less organized. For example, consider the market for\\nice cream in a particular town. Buyers of ice cream do not meet together at any onetime. The sellers of ice cream are in different locations and offer somewhat differ-ent products. There is no auctioneer calling out the price of ice cream. Each sellerposts a price for an ice-cream cone, and each buyer decides how much ice cream tobuy at each store.\\nEven though it is not organized, the group of ice-cream buyers and ice-cream\\nsellers forms a market. Each buyer knows that there are several sellers from whichto choose, and each seller is aware that his product is similar to that offered byother sellers. The price of ice cream and the quantity of ice cream sold are not de-termined by any single buyer or seller. Rather, price and quantity are determinedby all buyers and sellers as they interact in the marketplace.\\nThe market for ice cream, like most markets in the economy, is highly compet-\\nitive. A competitive market is a market in which there are many buyers and many\\nsellers so that each has a negligible impact on the market price. Each seller of icecream has limited control over the price because other sellers are offering similarproducts. A seller has little reason to charge less than the going price, and if he orshe charges more, buyers will make their purchases elsewhere. Similarly, no singlebuyer of ice cream can influence the price of ice cream because each buyer pur-chases only a small amount.\\nIn this chapter we examine how buyers and sellers interact in competitive\\nmarkets. We see how the forces of supply and demand determine both the quan-tity of the good sold and its price.\\nCOMPETITION: PERFECT AND OTHERWISE\\nWe assume in this chapter that markets are perfectly competitive. Perfectly competi-\\ntive markets are defined by two primary characteristics: (1) the goods being of-fered for sale are all the same, and (2) the buyers and sellers are so numerous thatmarket\\na group of buyers and sellers of aparticular good or service\\ncompetitive market\\na market in which there are manybuyers and many sellers so that eachhas a negligible impact on the marketpriceCHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 67\\nno single buyer or seller can influence the market price. Because buyers and sell-\\ners in perfectly competitive markets must accept the price the market determines,they are said to be price takers.\\nThere are some markets in which the assumption of perfect competition ap-\\nplies perfectly. In the wheat market, for example, there are thousands of farmerswho sell wheat and millions of consumers who use wheat and wheat products. Be-cause no single buyer or seller can influence the price of wheat, each takes theprice as given.\\nNot all goods and services, however, are sold in perfectly competitive markets.\\nSome markets have only one seller, and this seller sets the price. Such a seller iscalled a monopoly. Your local cable television company, for instance, may be a mo-\\nnopoly. Residents of your town probably have only one cable company fromwhich to buy this service.\\nSome markets fall between the extremes of perfect competition and monopoly.\\nOne such market, called an oligopoly, has a few sellers that do not always compete\\naggressively. Airline routes are an example. If a route between two cities is ser-viced by only two or three carriers, the carriers may avoid rigorous competition tokeep prices high. Another type of market is monopolistically competitive; it contains\\nmany sellers, each offering a slightly different product. Because the products arenot exactly the same, each seller has some ability to set the price for its own prod-uct. An example is the software industry. Many word processing programs com-pete with one another for users, but every program is different from every otherand has its own price.\\nDespite the diversity of market types we find in the world, we begin by study-\\ning perfect competition. Perfectly competitive markets are the easiest to analyze.Moreover, because some degree of competition is present in most markets, manyof the lessons that we learn by studying supply and demand under perfect com-petition apply in more complicated markets as well.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What is a market? NWhat does it mean for a market to be \\ncompetitive?\\nDEMAND\\nWe begin our study of markets by examining the behavior of buyers. Here we con-\\nsider what determines the quantity demanded of any good, which is the amount\\nof the good that buyers are willing and able to purchase. To focus our thinking,let’s keep in mind a particular good—ice cream.\\nWHAT DETERMINES THE QUANTITY AN\\nINDIVIDUAL DEMANDS?\\nConsider your own demand for ice cream. How do you decide how much ice\\ncream to buy each month, and what factors affect your decision? Here are some ofthe answers you might give.quantity demanded\\nthe amount of a good that buyers arewilling and able to purchase68 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nPrice If the price of ice cream rose to $20 per scoop, you would buy less ice\\ncream. You might buy frozen yogurt instead. If the price of ice cream fell to $0.20per scoop, you would buy more. Because the quantity demanded falls as the pricerises and rises as the price falls, we say that the quantity demanded is negatively re-\\nlated to the price. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is true\\nfor most goods in the economy and, in fact, is so pervasive that economists call itthe law of demand: Other things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quan-\\ntity demanded of the good falls.\\nIncome What would happen to your demand for ice cream if you lost your job\\none summer? Most likely, it would fall. A lower income means that you have lessto spend in total, so you would have to spend less on some—and probably most—goods. If the demand for a good falls when income falls, the good is called anormal good.\\nNot all goods are normal goods. If the demand for a good rises when income\\nfalls, the good is called an inferior good. An example of an inferior good might be\\nbus rides. As your income falls, you are less likely to buy a car or take a cab, andmore likely to ride the bus.\\nPrices of Related Goods Suppose that the price of frozen yogurt falls.\\nThe law of demand says that you will buy more frozen yogurt. At the same time,you will probably buy less ice cream. Because ice cream and frozen yogurt are bothcold, sweet, creamy desserts, they satisfy similar desires. When a fall in the priceof one good reduces the demand for another good, the two goods are calledsubstitutes. Substitutes are often pairs of goods that are used in place of each\\nother, such as hot dogs and hamburgers, sweaters and sweatshirts, and movie tick-ets and video rentals.\\nNow suppose that the price of hot fudge falls. According to the law of de-\\nmand, you will buy more hot fudge. Yet, in this case, you will buy more ice cream\\nas well, because ice cream and hot fudge are often used together. When a fall in theprice of one good raises the demand for another good, the two goods are calledcomplements. Complements are often pairs of goods that are used together,\\nsuch as gasoline and automobiles, computers and software, and skis and ski lifttickets.\\nTastes The most obvious determinant of your demand is your tastes. If you\\nlike ice cream, you buy more of it. Economists normally do not try to explain peo-ple’s tastes because tastes are based on historical and psychological forces that arebeyond the realm of economics. Economists do, however, examine what happenswhen tastes change.\\nExpectations Your expectations about the future may affect your demand\\nfor a good or service today. For example, if you expect to earn a higher income nextmonth, you may be more willing to spend some of your current savings buying icecream. As another example, if you expect the price of ice cream to fall tomorrow,you may be less willing to buy an ice-cream cone at today’s price.law of demand\\nthe claim that, other things equal, thequantity demanded of a good fallswhen the price of the good rises\\nnormal good\\na good for which, other things equal,an increase in income leads to anincrease in demand\\ninferior good\\na good for which, other things equal,an increase in income leads to adecrease in demand\\nsubstitutes\\ntwo goods for which an increase inthe price of one leads to an increasein the demand for the other\\ncomplements\\ntwo goods for which an increase inthe price of one leads to a decrease inthe demand for the otherCHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 69\\nTHE DEMAND SCHEDULE AND THE DEMAND CURVE\\nWe have seen that many variables determine the quantity of ice cream a person\\ndemands. Imagine that we hold all these variables constant except one—the price.Let’s consider how the price affects the quantity of ice cream demanded.\\nTable 4-1 shows how many ice-cream cones Catherine buys each month at dif-\\nferent prices of ice cream. If ice cream is free, Catherine eats 12 cones. At $0.50 percone, Catherine buys 10 cones. As the price rises further, she buys fewer and fewercones. When the price reaches $3.00, Catherine doesn’t buy any ice cream at all.Table 4-1 is a demand schedule, a table that shows the relationship between the\\nprice of a good and the quantity demanded. (Economists use the term schedule be-\\ncause the table, with its parallel columns of numbers, resembles a train schedule.)\\nFigure 4-1 graphs the numbers in Table 4-1. By convention, the price of\\nice cream is on the vertical axis, and the quantity of ice cream demanded is on the\\nTable 4-1\\nCATHERINE ’SDEMAND\\nSCHEDULE .

The downward-sloping line relating price and quantity demanded\\nis called the demand curve.\\nCETERIS PARIBUS\\nWhenever you see a demand curve, remember that it is drawn holding many\\nthings constant. Catherine’s demand curve in Figure 4-1 shows what happens tothe quantity of ice cream Catherine demands when only the price of ice creamvaries. The curve is drawn assuming that Catherine’s income, tastes, expectations,and the prices of related products are not changing.\\nEconomists use the term ceteris paribus to signify that all the relevant vari-\\nables, except those being studied at that moment, are held constant. The Latinphrase literally means “other things being equal.” The demand curve slopesdownward because, ceteris paribus, lower prices mean a greater quantity\\ndemanded.\\nAlthough the term ceteris paribus refers to a hypothetical situation in which\\nsome variables are assumed to be constant, in the real world many things changeat the same time. For this reason, when we use the tools of supply and demand toanalyze events or policies, it is important to keep in mind what is being held con-stant and what is not.\\nMARKET DEMAND VERSUS INDIVIDUAL DEMAND\\nSo far we have talked about an individual’s demand for a product. To analyze howmarkets work, we need to determine the market demand, which is the sum of all the\\nindividual demands for a particular good or service.\\nCatherine’s Demand\\nPrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nConePrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nConeNicholas’s Demand\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Quantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones$3.00\\n1.502.002.50\\n1.00\\n0.50\\n0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 Quantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones$3.00\\n1.502.002.50\\n1.00\\n0.50/H11545demand curve\\na graph of the relationship betweenthe price of a good and the quantitydemanded\\nceteris paribus\\na Latin phrase, translated as “otherthings being equal,” used as areminder that all variables other thanthe ones being studied are assumedto be constantCHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 71\\nTable 4-2 shows the demand schedules for ice cream of two individuals—\\nCatherine and Nicholas. At any price, Catherine’s demand schedule tells us howmuch ice cream she buys, and Nicholas’s demand schedule tells us how much icecream he buys. The market demand is the sum of the two individual demands.\\nBecause market demand is derived from individual demands, it depends on\\nall those factors that determine the demand of individual buyers. Thus, market de-mand depends on buyers’ incomes, tastes, expectations, and the prices of relatedgoods. It also depends on the number of buyers. (If Peter, another consumer of icecream, were to join Catherine and Nicholas, the quantity demanded in the marketwould be higher at every price.) The demand schedules in Table 4-2 show whathappens to quantity demanded as the price varies while all the other variables thatdetermine quantity demanded are held constant.\\nFigure 4-2 shows the demand curves that correspond to these demand sched-\\nules. Notice that we sum the individual demand curves horizontally to obtain the\\nMarket Demand\\n(/H11005 4 /H11001 3)Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 Quantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones$3.00\\n1.502.002.50\\n1.00\\n0.50/H11549Figure 4-2\\nMARKET DEMAND AS THE SUM\\nOFINDIVIDUAL DEMANDS .

That is, to find the total quantity demanded at any price,\\nwe add the individual quantities found on the horizontal axis of the individual de-mand curves. Because we are interested in analyzing how markets work, we willwork most often with the market demand curve. The market demand curve showshow the total quantity demanded of a good varies as the price of the good varies.\\nSHIFTS IN THE DEMAND CURVE\\nSuppose that the American Medical Association suddenly announces a new dis-covery: People who regularly eat ice cream live longer, healthier lives. How doesthis announcement affect the market for ice cream? The discovery changes peo-ple’s tastes and raises the demand for ice cream. At any given price, buyers nowwant to purchase a larger quantity of ice cream, and the demand curve for icecream shifts to the right.\\nWhenever any determinant of demand changes, other than the good’s price,\\nthe demand curve shifts. As Figure 4-3 shows, any change that increases the quan-tity demanded at every price shifts the demand curve to the right. Similarly, anychange that reduces the quantity demanded at every price shifts the demand curveto the left.\\nTable 4-3 lists the variables that determine the quantity demanded in a market\\nand how a change in the variable affects the demand curve. Notice that price playsa special role in this table. Because price is on the vertical axis when we graph ademand curve, a change in price does not shift the curve but represents a move-ment along it. By contrast, when there is a change in income, the prices of relatedgoods, tastes, expectations, or the number of buyers, the quantity demanded ateach price changes; this is represented by a shift in the demand curve.\\nPrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\nQuantity of\\nIce-Cream ConesIncreasein demand\\nDecrease\\nin demand\\nDemand curve, \\nD3Demand\\ncurve, D1Demand\\ncurve, D2\\n0Figure 4-3\\nSHIFTS IN THE DEMAND CURVE .\\nAny change that raises thequantity that buyers wish topurchase at a given price shiftsthe demand curve to the right.Any change that lowers thequantity that buyers wish topurchase at a given price shiftsthe demand curve to the left.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 73\\nCASE STUDY TWO WAYS TO REDUCE THE QUANTITY\\nOF SMOKING DEMANDED\\nPublic policymakers often want to reduce the amount that people smoke. There\\nare two ways that policy can attempt to achieve this goal.\\nOne way to reduce smoking is to shift the demand curve for cigarettes and\\nother tobacco products. Public service announcements, mandatory health warn-ings on cigarette packages, and the prohibition of cigarette advertising on tele-vision are all policies aimed at reducing the quantity of cigarettes demanded atany given price. If successful, these policies shift the demand curve for ciga-rettes to the left, as in panel (a) of Figure 4-4.\\nAlternatively, policymakers can try to raise the price of cigarettes. If the\\ngovernment taxes the manufacture of cigarettes, for example, cigarette compa-nies pass much of this tax on to consumers in the form of higher prices. A higherprice encourages smokers to reduce the numbers of cigarettes they smoke. Inthis case, the reduced amount of smoking does not represent a shift in the de-mand curve. Instead, it represents a movement along the same demand curveto a point with a higher price and lower quantity, as in panel (b) of Figure 4-4.\\nHow much does the amount of smoking respond to changes in the price of\\ncigarettes? Economists have attempted to answer this question by studyingwhat happens when the tax on cigarettes changes. They have found that a10 percent increase in the price causes a 4 percent reduction in the quantity de-manded. Teenagers are found to be especially sensitive to the price of cigarettes:A 10 percent increase in the price causes a 12 percent drop in teenage smoking.\\nA related question is how the price of cigarettes affects the demand for illicit\\ndrugs, such as marijuana. Opponents of cigarette taxes often argue that tobaccoand marijuana are substitutes, so that high cigarette prices encourage marijuanause. By contrast, many experts on substance abuse view tobacco as a “gatewaydrug” leading the young to experiment with other harmful substances. Moststudies of the data are consistent with this view: They find that lower cigaretteprices are associated with greater use of marijuana. In other words, tobacco andmarijuana appear to be complements rather than substitutes.In summary, the demand curve shows what happens to the quantity demanded of a\\ngood when its price varies, holding constant all other determinants of quantity demanded.When one of these other determinants changes, the demand curve shifts.Table 4-3\\nTHEDETERMINANTS OF\\nQUANTITY DEMANDED . This\\ntable lists the variables that caninfluence the quantity demandedin a market.

In panel (b), whenthe price rises from $2 to $4, thequantity demanded falls from 20to 12 cigarettes per day, asreflected by the movement frompoint A to point C.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 75\\nSUPPLY\\nWe now turn to the other side of the market and examine the behavior of sellers.\\nThe quantity supplied of any good or service is the amount that sellers are willing\\nand able to sell. Once again, to focus our thinking, let’s consider the market for icecream and look at the factors that determine the quantity supplied.\\nWHAT DETERMINES THE QUANTITY\\nAN INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIES?\\nImagine that you are running Student Sweets, a company that produces and sells\\nice cream. What determines the quantity of ice cream you are willing to produceand offer for sale? Here are some possible answers.\\nPrice The price of ice cream is one determinant of the quantity supplied. When\\nthe price of ice cream is high, selling ice cream is profitable, and so the quantitysupplied is large. As a seller of ice cream, you work long hours, buy many ice-cream machines, and hire many workers. By contrast, when the price of ice creamis low, your business is less profitable, and so you will produce less ice cream. Atan even lower price, you may choose to go out of business altogether, and yourquantity supplied falls to zero.\\nBecause the quantity supplied rises as the price rises and falls as the price falls,\\nwe say that the quantity supplied is positively related to the price of the good. This\\nrelationship between price and quantity supplied is called the law of supply:\\nOther things equal, when the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of thegood also rises.\\nInput Prices To produce its output of ice cream, Student Sweets uses various\\ninputs: cream, sugar, flavoring, ice-cream machines, the buildings in which the icecream is made, and the labor of workers to mix the ingredients and operate themachines. When the price of one or more of these inputs rises, producing ice creamis less profitable, and your firm supplies less ice cream. If input prices rise sub-stantially, you might shut down your firm and supply no ice cream at all. Thus, thesupply of a good is negatively related to the price of the inputs used to make thegood.\\nTechnology The technology for turning the inputs into ice cream is yet an-\\nother determinant of supply. The invention of the mechanized ice-cream machine,for example, reduced the amount of labor necessary to make ice cream. By reduc-ing firms’ costs, the advance in technology raised the supply of ice cream.\\nExpectations The amount of ice cream you supply today may depend on\\nyour expectations of the future. For example, if you expect the price of ice cream torise in the future, you will put some of your current production into storage andsupply less to the market today.quantity supplied\\nthe amount of a good that sellers arewilling and able to sell\\nlaw of supply\\nthe claim that, other things equal, thequantity supplied of a good riseswhen the price of the good rises76 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nTHE SUPPLY SCHEDULE AND THE SUPPLY CURVE\\nConsider how the quantity supplied varies with the price, holding input prices,\\ntechnology, and expectations constant. Table 4-4 shows the quantity supplied byBen, an ice-cream seller, at various prices of ice cream. At a price below $1.00, Bendoes not supply any ice cream at all. As the price rises, he supplies a greater andgreater quantity. This table is called the supply schedule.\\nFigure 4-5 graphs the relationship between the quantity of ice cream supplied\\nand the price. The curve relating price and quantity supplied is called the supply\\ncurve. The supply curve slopes upward because, ceteris paribus, a higher price\\nmeans a greater quantity supplied.\\nTable 4-4\\nBEN’SSUPPLY SCHEDULE . The\\nsupply schedule shows thequantity supplied at each price.PRICEOF ICE-CREAM CONE QUANTITY OF CONES SUPPLIED\\n$0.00 0\\n0.50 01.00 11.50 22.00 32.50 43.00 5supply schedule\\na table that shows the relationshipbetween the price of a good and thequantity supplied\\nsupply curve\\na graph of the relationship betweenthe price of a good and the quantitysupplied\\nPrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n02.50\\n2.00\\n1.50\\n1.00\\n1234567891011 Quantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones$3.00\\n120.50Figure 4-5\\nBEN’SSUPPLY CURVE . This\\nsupply curve, which graphs thesupply schedule in Table 4-4,shows how the quantity suppliedof the good changes as its pricevaries. Because a higher priceincreases the quantity supplied,the supply curve slopes upward.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 77\\nMARKET SUPPLY VERSUS INDIVIDUAL SUPPLY\\nJust as market demand is the sum of the demands of all buyers, market supply is\\nthe sum of the supplies of all sellers. Table 4-5 shows the supply schedules for twoice-cream producers—Ben and Jerry. At any price, Ben’s supply schedule tells usthe quantity of ice cream Ben supplies, and Jerry’s supply schedule tells us thequantity of ice cream Jerry supplies. The market supply is the sum of the two in-dividual supplies.\\nMarket supply depends on all those factors that influence the supply of indi-\\nvidual sellers, such as the prices of inputs used to produce the good, the availabletechnology, and expectations. In addition, the supply in a market depends on thenumber of sellers. (If Ben or Jerry were to retire from the ice-cream business, thesupply in the market would fall.) The supply schedules in Table 4-5 show whathappens to quantity supplied as the price varies while all the other variables thatdetermine quantity supplied are held constant.\\nFigure 4-6 shows the supply curves that correspond to the supply schedules in\\nTable 4-5. As with demand curves, we sum the individual supply curves horizon-\\ntally to obtain the market supply curve. That is, to find the total quantity supplied\\nat any price, we add the individual quantities found on the horizontal axis of theindividual supply curves. The market supply curve shows how the total quantitysupplied varies as the price of the good varies.\\nSHIFTS IN THE SUPPLY CURVE\\nSuppose that the price of sugar falls. How does this change affect the supply of icecream? Because sugar is an input into producing ice cream, the fall in the price ofsugar makes selling ice cream more profitable. This raises the supply of ice cream:At any given price, sellers are now willing to produce a larger quantity. Thus, thesupply curve for ice cream shifts to the right.\\nWhenever there is a change in any determinant of supply, other than the\\ngood’s price, the supply curve shifts. As Figure 4-7 shows, any change that raisesquantity supplied at every price shifts the supply curve to the right. Similarly, anychange that reduces the quantity supplied at every price shifts the supply curve tothe left.\\nTable 4-5\\nINDIVIDUAL AND MARKET\\nSUPPLY SCHEDULES .

Once again, price playsa special role in the table. Because price is on the vertical axis when we graph asupply curve, a change in price does not shift the curve but represents a movementalong it. By contrast, when there is a change in input prices, technology, expecta-tions, or the number of sellers, the quantity supplied at each price changes; this isrepresented by a shift in the supply curve.\\nIn summary, the supply curve shows what happens to the quantity supplied of a good\\nwhen its price varies, holding constant all other determinants of quantity supplied. Whenone of these other determinants changes, the supply curve shifts.Market Supply\\n(/H11005 3 /H11001 4)Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Quantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones$3.00\\n1.502.002.50\\n1.00\\n0.50/H11549Figure 4-6\\nMARKET SUPPLY AS THE SUMOF\\nINDIVIDUAL SUPPLIES .

The price at which these two curves\\ncross is called the equilibrium price, and the quantity is called the equilibrium\\nquantity. Here the equilibrium price is $2.00 per cone, and the equilibrium quan-\\ntity is 7 ice-cream cones.\\nThe dictionary defines the word equilibrium as a situation in which vari-\\nous forces are in balance—and this also describes a market’s equilibrium.

The equilibrium\\nis found where the supply anddemand curves intersect. At theequilibrium price, the quantitysupplied equals the quantitydemanded. Here the equilibriumprice is $2: At this price, 7 ice-cream cones are supplied, and7 ice-cream cones are demanded.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 81\\nequilibrium price, the quantity of the good that buyers are willing and able to buy exactly\\nbalances the quantity that sellers are willing and able to sell. The equilibrium price is\\nsometimes called the market-clearing price because, at this price, everyone in the\\nmarket has been satisfied: Buyers have bought all they want to buy, and sellershave sold all they want to sell.\\nThe actions of buyers and sellers naturally move markets toward the equilib-\\nrium of supply and demand. To see why, consider what happens when the marketprice is not equal to the equilibrium price.\\nSuppose first that the market price is above the equilibrium price, as in panel\\n(a) of Figure 4-9. At a price of $2.50 per cone, the quantity of the good supplied(10 cones) exceeds the quantity demanded (4 cones). There is a surplus of the\\ngood: Suppliers are unable to sell all they want at the going price. When there is asurplus in the ice-cream market, for instance, sellers of ice cream find their freez-ers increasingly full of ice cream they would like to sell but cannot. They respondto the surplus by cutting their prices. Prices continue to fall until the marketreaches the equilibrium.\\nSuppose now that the market price is below the equilibrium price, as in panel\\n(b) of Figure 4-9. In this case, the price is $1.50 per cone, and the quantity of thegood demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. There is a shortage of the good:\\nDemanders are unable to buy all they want at the going price. When a shortage oc-curs in the ice-cream market, for instance, buyers have to wait in long lines fora chance to buy one of the few cones that are available. With too many buyerschasing too few goods, sellers can respond to the shortage by raising their priceswithout losing sales. As prices rise, the market once again moves toward theequilibrium.\\nThus, the activities of the many buyers and sellers automatically push the mar-\\nket price toward the equilibrium price. Once the market reaches its equilibrium, allbuyers and sellers are satisfied, and there is no upward or downward pressure onthe price. How quickly equilibrium is reached varies from market to market, de-pending on how quickly prices adjust. In most free markets, however, surplusesand shortages are only temporary because prices eventually move toward theirequilibrium levels. Indeed, this phenomenon is so pervasive that it is sometimescalled the law of supply and demand: The price of any good adjusts to bring the\\nsupply and demand for that good into balance.\\nTHREE STEPS TO ANALYZING CHANGES IN EQUILIBRIUM\\nSo far we have seen how supply and demand together determine a market’s equi-librium, which in turn determines the price of the good and the amount of thegood that buyers purchase and sellers produce. Of course, the equilibrium priceand quantity depend on the position of the supply and demand curves. Whensome event shifts one of these curves, the equilibrium in the market changes. Theanalysis of such a change is called comparative statics because it involves compar-\\ning two static situations—an old and a new equilibrium.\\nWhen analyzing how some event affects a market, we proceed in three steps.\\nFirst, we decide whether the event shifts the supply curve, the demand curve, orin some cases both curves. Second, we decide whether the curve shifts to the rightor to the left. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to examine how thesurplus\\na situation in which quantitysupplied is greater than quantitydemanded\\nshortage\\na situation in which quantitydemanded is greater than quantitysupplied\\nlaw of supply and demand\\nthe claim that the price of any goodadjusts to bring the supply anddemand for that good into balance82 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nPrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n2.00$2.50\\n04 7 1 0 Quantity of \\nIce-Cream ConesSupply\\nDemand(a) Excess Supply\\nQuantity\\ndemandedQuantity\\nsuppliedSurplus\\nPrice of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n$2.00\\n1.50\\n04 7 1 0 Quantity of \\nIce-Cream ConesSupply\\nDemand(b) Excess Demand\\nQuantity\\nsuppliedQuantity\\ndemandedShortageFigure 4-9\\nMARKETS NOT IN EQUILIBRIUM .\\nIn panel (a), there is a surplus.Because the market price of $2.50is above the equilibrium price,the quantity supplied (10 cones)exceeds the quantity demanded(4 cones). Suppliers try toincrease sales by cutting the priceof a cone, and this moves theprice toward its equilibriumlevel. In panel (b), there is ashortage. Because the marketprice of $1.50 is below theequilibrium price, the quantitydemanded (10 cones) exceeds thequantity supplied (4 cones). Withtoo many buyers chasing too fewgoods, suppliers can takeadvantage of the shortage byraising the price. Hence, in bothcases, the price adjustmentmoves the market toward theequilibrium of supply anddemand.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 83\\nshift affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Table 4-7 summarizes these three\\nsteps. To see how this recipe is used, let’s consider various events that might affectthe market for ice cream.\\nExample: A Change in Demand Suppose that one summer the weather\\nis very hot. How does this event affect the market for ice cream? To answer thisquestion, let’s follow our three steps.\\n1. The hot weather affects the demand curve by changing people’s taste for ice\\ncream. That is, the weather changes the amount of ice cream that peoplewant to buy at any given price. The supply curve is unchanged because theweather does not directly affect the firms that sell ice cream.\\n2. Because hot weather makes people want to eat more ice cream, the demand\\ncurve shifts to the right. Figure 4-10 shows this increase in demand as theshift in the demand curve from D\\n1to D2. This shift indicates that the quantity\\nof ice cream demanded is higher at every price.\\n3. As Figure 4-10 shows, the increase in demand raises the equilibrium price\\nfrom $2.00 to $2.50 and the equilibrium quantity from 7 to 10 cones. In otherwords, the hot weather increases the price of ice cream and the quantity ofice cream sold.\\nShifts in Curves versus Movements along Curves Notice that when\\nhot weather drives up the price of ice cream, the quantity of ice cream that firms sup-ply rises, even though the supply curve remains the same. In this case, economistssay there has been an increase in “quantity supplied” but no change in “supply.”\\nTable 4-7\\nAT HREE -STEPPROGRAMFOR\\nANALYZING CHANGES IN\\nEQUILIBRIUM1. Decide whether the event shifts the supply curve or demand curve (or perhaps\\nboth).\\n2. Decide which direction the curve shifts.3. Use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift changes the\\nequilibrium.84 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\n“Supply” refers to the position of the supply curve, whereas the “quantity sup-\\nplied” refers to the amount suppliers wish to sell. In this example, supply does notchange because the weather does not alter firms’ desire to sell at any given price. In-stead, the hot weather alters consumers’ desire to buy at any given price andthereby shifts the demand curve. The increase in demand causes the equilibriumprice to rise. When the price rises, the quantity supplied rises. This increase in quan-tity supplied is represented by the movement along the supply curve.\\nTo summarize, a shift inthe supply curve is called a “change in supply,” and a\\nshift inthe demand curve is called a “change in demand.” A movement along a\\nfixed supply curve is called a “change in the quantity supplied,” and a movementalong a fixed demand curve is called a “change in the quantity demanded.”\\nExample: A Change in Supply Suppose that, during another summer,\\nan earthquake destroys several ice-cream factories. How does this event affect themarket for ice cream? Once again, to answer this question, we follow our threesteps.\\n1. The earthquake affects the supply curve. By reducing the number of sellers,\\nthe earthquake changes the amount of ice cream that firms produce and sell at any given price. The demand curve is unchanged because theearthquake does not directly change the amount of ice cream householdswish to buy.\\n2. The supply curve shifts to the left because, at every price, the total amount\\nthat firms are willing and able to sell is reduced. Figure 4-11 illustrates thisdecrease in supply as a shift in the supply curve from S\\n1to S2.Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n2.00$2.50\\n07 1 0 Quantity of \\nIce-Cream ConesSupply\\nNew equilibrium\\nInitial\\nequilibrium\\nD1D2\\n3. . . . and a higherquantity sold.2. . . . resultingin a higherprice . . .1.

Thedemand curve shifts from D\\n1to\\nD2, which causes the equilibrium\\nprice to rise from $2.00 to $2.50and the equilibrium quantity torise from 7 to 10 cones.CHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 85\\n3. As Figure 4-11 shows, the shift in the supply curve raises the equilibrium\\nprice from $2.00 to $2.50 and lowers the equilibrium quantity from 7 to 4cones. As a result of the earthquake, the price of ice cream rises, and thequantity of ice cream sold falls.\\nExample: A Change in Both Supply and Demand Now suppose\\nthat the hot weather and the earthquake occur at the same time. To analyze thiscombination of events, we again follow our three steps.\\n1. We determine that both curves must shift. The hot weather affects the\\ndemand curve because it alters the amount of ice cream that householdswant to buy at any given price. At the same time, the earthquake alters thesupply curve because it changes the amount of ice cream that firms want tosell at any given price.\\n2. The curves shift in the same directions as they did in our previous analysis:\\nThe demand curve shifts to the right, and the supply curve shifts to the left.Figure 4-12 illustrates these shifts.\\n3. As Figure 4-12 shows, there are two possible outcomes that might result,\\ndepending on the relative size of the demand and supply shifts. In bothcases, the equilibrium price rises. In panel (a), where demand increasessubstantially while supply falls just a little, the equilibrium quantity alsorises. By contrast, in panel (b), where supply falls substantially whiledemand rises just a little, the equilibrium quantity falls. Thus, these eventscertainly raise the price of ice cream, but their impact on the amount of icecream sold is ambiguous.Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n2.00$2.50\\n04 7 Quantity of \\nIce-Cream ConesDemandNew\\nequilibrium\\nInitial equilibriumS1S2\\n2. . . . resulting\\nin a higherprice . . .1.

Although our\\ndiscussion has centered around the market for ice cream, the lessons learned hereapply in most other markets as well. Whenever you go to a store to buy something,you are contributing to the demand for that item. Whenever you look for a job,you are contributing to the supply of labor services. Because supply and demandare such pervasive economic phenomena, the model of supply and demand is apowerful tool for analysis. We will be using this model repeatedly in the followingchapters.\\nOne of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are\\nusually a good way to organize economic activity. Although it is still too early tojudge whether market outcomes are good or bad, in this chapter we have begun tosee how markets work. In any economic system, scarce resources have to be allo-cated among competing uses. Market economies harness the forces of supply anddemand to serve that end. Supply and demand together determine the prices ofthe economy’s many different goods and services; prices in turn are the signalsthat guide the allocation of resources.\\nFor example, consider the allocation of beachfront land. Because the amount\\nof this land is limited, not everyone can enjoy the luxury of living by the beach.Who gets this resource? The answer is: whoever is willing and able to pay theprice. The price of beachfront land adjusts until the quantity of land demanded ex-actly balances the quantity supplied. Thus, in market economies, prices are themechanism for rationing scarce resources.\\nSimilarly, prices determine who produces each good and how much is pro-\\nduced. For instance, consider farming. Because we need food to survive, it is cru-cial that some people work on farms. What determines who is a farmer and who isnot? In a free society, there is no government planning agency making this decisionand ensuring an adequate supply of food. Instead, the allocation of workers tofarms is based on the job decisions of millions of workers. This decentralized sys-tem works well because these decisions depend on prices. The prices of food andthe wages of farmworkers (the price of their labor) adjust to ensure that enoughpeople choose to be farmers.\\nIf a person had never seen a market economy in action, the whole idea might\\nseem preposterous. Economies are large groups of people engaged in many inter-dependent activities. What prevents decentralized decisionmaking from degen-erating into chaos? What coordinates the actions of the millions of people withtheir varying abilities and desires? What ensures that what needs to get donedoes in fact get done? The answer, in a word, is prices. If market economies\\nare guided by an invisible hand, as Adam Smith famously suggested, then theprice system is the baton that the invisible hand uses to conduct the economicorchestra.\\nCHAPTER 4 THE MARKET FORCES OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND 89\\n“—and seventy-five cents.” “Two dollars.”\\nN Economists use the model of supply and demand \\nto analyze competitive markets. In a competitivemarket, there are many buyers and sellers, each of whom has little or no influence on the market price.\\nN The demand curve shows how the quantity of a good\\ndemanded depends on the price. According to the lawof demand, as the price of a good falls, the quantitydemanded rises. Therefore, the demand curve slopesdownward.\\nN In addition to price, other determinants of the quantity\\ndemanded include income, tastes, expectations, and the prices of substitutes and complements. If one ofthese other determinants changes, the demand curveshifts.\\nN The supply curve shows how the quantity of a good\\nsupplied depends on the price. According to the law ofsupply, as the price of a good rises, the quantitysupplied rises. Therefore, the supply curve slopesupward.\\nN In addition to price, other determinants of the quantity\\nsupplied include input prices, technology, andexpectations. If one of these other determinants changes,the supply curve shifts.\\nN The intersection of the supply and demand curves\\ndetermines the market equilibrium. At the equilibriumprice, the quantity demanded equals the quantity\\nsupplied.\\nN The behavior of buyers and sellers naturally drives\\nmarkets toward their equilibrium. When the marketprice is above the equilibrium price, there is a surplus of the good, which causes the market price to fall. When the market price is below the equilibriumprice, there is a shortage, which causes the market priceto rise.\\nN To analyze how any event influences a market, we use\\nthe supply-and-demand diagram to examine how theevent affects the equilibrium price and quantity. To dothis we follow three steps. First, we decide whether theevent shifts the supply curve or the demand curve (orboth). Second, we decide which direction the curveshifts. Third, we compare the new equilibrium with theold equilibrium.\\nN In market economies, prices are the signals that guide\\neconomic decisions and thereby allocate scarceresources. For every good in the economy, the priceensures that supply and demand are in balance. Theequilibrium price then determines how much of thegood buyers choose to purchase and how much sellerschoose to produce.\\nSummary90 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nmarket, p. 66\\ncompetitive market, p. 66quantity demanded, p. 67law of demand, p. 68normal good, p. 68inferior good, p. 68substitutes, p. 68complements, p. 68\\ndemand schedule, p. 69demand curve, p. 70ceteris paribus, p. 70\\nquantity supplied, p. 75law of supply, p. 75supply schedule, p. 76supply curve, p. 76\\nequilibrium, p. 80equilibrium price, p. 80equilibrium quantity, p. 80surplus, p. 81shortage, p. 81law of supply and demand, p. 81\\nKey Concepts\\n1.

Because you earn all your income\\nfrom selling wheat, you devote much effort to making your land as productive asit can be. You monitor weather and soil conditions, check your fields for pests anddisease, and study the latest advances in farm technology. You know that the morewheat you grow, the more you will have to sell after the harvest, and the higherwill be your income and your standard of living.\\nOne day Kansas State University announces a major discovery. Researchers in\\nits agronomy department have devised a new hybrid of wheat that raises theamount farmers can produce from each acre of land by 20 percent. How shouldyou react to this news? Should you use the new hybrid? Does this discovery makeyou better off or worse off than you were before? In this chapter we will seethat these questions can have surprising answers. The surprise will come fromELASTICITY AND\\nITS APPLICATION\\n9394 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\napplying the most basic tools of economics—supply and demand—to the market\\nfor wheat.\\nThe previous chapter introduced supply and demand. In any competitive\\nmarket, such as the market for wheat, the upward-sloping supply curve representsthe behavior of sellers, and the downward-sloping demand curve represents thebehavior of buyers. The price of the good adjusts to bring the quantity suppliedand quantity demanded of the good into balance. To apply this basic analysis tounderstand the impact of the agronomists’ discovery, we must first develop onemore tool: the concept of elasticity. Elasticity, a measure of how much buyers and\\nsellers respond to changes in market conditions, allows us to analyze supply anddemand with greater precision.\\nTHE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\\nWhen we discussed the determinants of demand in Chapter 4, we noted that buy-ers usually demand more of a good when its price is lower, when their incomes arehigher, when the prices of substitutes for the good are higher, or when the pricesof complements of the good are lower. Our discussion of demand was qualitative,not quantitative. That is, we discussed the direction in which the quantity de-manded moves, but not the size of the change. To measure how much demand re-sponds to changes in its determinants, economists use the concept of elasticity.\\nTHE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\\nAND ITS DETERMINANTS\\nThe law of demand states that a fall in the price of a good raises the quantity de-\\nmanded. The price elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity de-\\nmanded responds to a change in price. Demand for a good is said to be elastic if the\\nquantity demanded responds substantially to changes in the price. Demand is saidto be inelastic if the quantity demanded responds only slightly to changes in the\\nprice.\\nWhat determines whether the demand for a good is elastic or inelastic? Be-\\ncause the demand for any good depends on consumer preferences, the price elas-ticity of demand depends on the many economic, social, and psychological forcesthat shape individual desires. Based on experience, however, we can state somegeneral rules about what determines the price elasticity of demand.\\nNecessities versus Luxuries Necessities tend to have inelastic de-\\nmands, whereas luxuries have elastic demands. When the price of a visit to thedoctor rises, people will not dramatically alter the number of times they go to thedoctor, although they might go somewhat less often. By contrast, when the price ofsailboats rises, the quantity of sailboats demanded falls substantially. The reason isthat most people view doctor visits as a necessity and sailboats as a luxury. Ofcourse, whether a good is a necessity or a luxury depends not on the intrinsicproperties of the good but on the preferences of the buyer. For an avid sailor withelasticity\\na measure of the responsiveness ofquantity demanded or quantitysupplied to one of its determinants\\nprice elasticity of demand\\na measure of how much the quantitydemanded of a good responds to achange in the price of that good,computed as the percentage changein quantity demanded divided by thepercentage change in priceCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 95\\nlittle concern over his health, sailboats might be a necessity with inelastic demand\\nand doctor visits a luxury with elastic demand.\\nAvailability of Close Substitutes Goods with close substitutes tend\\nto have more elastic demand because it is easier for consumers to switch from thatgood to others. For example, butter and margarine are easily substitutable. A smallincrease in the price of butter, assuming the price of margarine is held fixed, causesthe quantity of butter sold to fall by a large amount. By contrast, because eggs area food without a close substitute, the demand for eggs is probably less elastic thanthe demand for butter.\\nDefinition of the Market The elasticity of demand in any market de-\\npends on how we draw the boundaries of the market. Narrowly defined marketstend to have more elastic demand than broadly defined markets, because it iseasier to find close substitutes for narrowly defined goods. For example, food, abroad category, has a fairly inelastic demand because there are no good substitutesfor food. Ice cream, a more narrow category, has a more elastic demand because itis easy to substitute other desserts for ice cream. Vanilla ice cream, a very narrowcategory, has a very elastic demand because other flavors of ice cream are almostperfect substitutes for vanilla.\\nTime Horizon Goods tend to have more elastic demand over longer time\\nhorizons. When the price of gasoline rises, the quantity of gasoline demanded fallsonly slightly in the first few months. Over time, however, people buy more fuel-efficient cars, switch to public transportation, and move closer to where they work.Within several years, the quantity of gasoline demanded falls substantially.\\nCOMPUTING THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\\nNow that we have discussed the price elasticity of demand in general terms, let’sbe more precise about how it is measured. Economists compute the price elasticityof demand as the percentage change in the quantity demanded divided by the per-centage change in the price. That is,\\nPrice elasticity of demand /H11005 .\\nFor example, suppose that a 10-percent increase in the price of an ice-cream cone\\ncauses the amount of ice cream you buy to fall by 20 percent. We calculate yourelasticity of demand as\\nPrice elasticity of demand /H11005/H11005 2.\\nIn this example, the elasticity is 2, reflecting that the change in the quantity de-\\nmanded is proportionately twice as large as the change in the price.\\nBecause the quantity demanded of a good is negatively related to its price,\\nthe percentage change in quantity will always have the opposite sign as the20 percent\\n10 percentPercentage change in quantity demanded\\nPercentage change in price96 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\npercentage change in price. In this example, the percentage change in price is a pos-\\nitive 10 percent (reflecting an increase), and the percentage change in quantity de-\\nmanded is a negative 20 percent (reflecting a decrease). For this reason, price\\nelasticities of demand are sometimes reported as negative numbers. In this bookwe follow the common practice of dropping the minus sign and reporting all priceelasticities as positive numbers. (Mathematicians call this the absolute value. ) With\\nthis convention, a larger price elasticity implies a greater responsiveness of quan-tity demanded to price.\\nTHE MIDPOINT METHOD: A BETTER WAY TO CALCULATE\\nPERCENTAGE CHANGES AND ELASTICITIES\\nIf you try calculating the price elasticity of demand between two points on a de-\\nmand curve, you will quickly notice an annoying problem: The elasticity frompoint A to point B seems different from the elasticity from point B to point A. Forexample, consider these numbers:\\nPoint A: Price /H11005$4 Quantity /H11005120\\nPoint B: Price /H11005$6 Quantity /H1100580\\nGoing from point A to point B, the price rises by 50 percent, and the quantity falls\\nby 33 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 33/50, or 0.66.By contrast, going from point B to point A, the price falls by 33 percent, and thequantity rises by 50 percent, indicating that the price elasticity of demand is 50/33,or 1.5.\\nOne way to avoid this problem is to use the midpoint method for calculating\\nelasticities. Rather than computing a percentage change using the standard way(by dividing the change by the initial level), the midpoint method computes apercentage change by dividing the change by the midpoint of the initial and finallevels. For instance, $5 is the midpoint of $4 and $6. Therefore, according to themidpoint method, a change from $4 to $6 is considered a 40 percent rise, because(6 /H110024)/5 /H11003100 /H1100540. Similarly, a change from $6 to $4 is considered a 40 per-\\ncent fall.\\nBecause the midpoint method gives the same answer regardless of the direc-\\ntion of change, it is often used when calculating the price elasticity of demand be-tween two points. In our example, the midpoint between point A and point B is:\\nMidpoint: Price /H11005$5 Quantity /H11005100\\nAccording to the midpoint method, when going from point A to point B, the price\\nrises by 40 percent, and the quantity falls by 40 percent. Similarly, when goingfrom point B to point A, the price falls by 40 percent, and the quantity rises by40 percent. In both directions, the price elasticity of demand equals 1.\\nWe can express the midpoint method with the following formula for the price\\nelasticity of demand between two points, denoted ( Q\\n1, P1) and ( Q2, P2):\\nPrice elasticity of demand /H11005 .(Q2/H11002Q1)/[(Q2/H11001Q1)/2]\\n(P2/H11002P1)/[(P2/H11001P1)/2](a) Perfectly Inelastic Demand: Elasticity Equals 0\\n$5\\n4Demand\\nQuantity 100 0(b) Inelastic Demand: Elasticity Is Less Than 1\\n$5\\n4\\nQuantity 100 0 90Demand\\n(c) Unit Elastic Demand: Elasticity Equals 1\\n$5\\n4\\nDemand\\nQuantity 100 0Price\\n801.

Note that all percentage changes are calculated using\\nthe midpoint method.98 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nThe numerator is the percentage change in quantity computed using the midpoint\\nmethod, and the denominator is the percentage change in price computed usingthe midpoint method. If you ever need to calculate elasticities, you should use thisformula.\\nThroughout this book, however, we only rarely need to perform such calcula-\\ntions. For our purposes, what elasticity represents—the responsiveness of quantitydemanded to price—is more important than how it is calculated.\\nTHE VARIETY OF DEMAND CURVES\\nEconomists classify demand curves according to their elasticity. Demand is elastic\\nwhen the elasticity is greater than 1, so that quantity moves proportionately morethan the price. Demand is inelastic when the elasticity is less than 1, so that quan-\\ntity moves proportionately less than the price. If the elasticity is exactly 1, so thatquantity moves the same amount proportionately as price, demand is said to haveunit elasticity.\\nBecause the price elasticity of demand measures how much quantity de-\\nmanded responds to changes in the price, it is closely related to the slope of the de-mand curve. The following rule of thumb is a useful guide: The flatter is thedemand curve that passes through a given point, the greater is the price elasticityof demand. The steeper is the demand curve that passes through a given point, thesmaller is the price elasticity of demand.\\nFigure 5-1 shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, demand is\\nperfectly inelastic, and the demand curve is vertical. In this case, regardless of the\\nprice, the quantity demanded stays the same. As the elasticity rises, the demandcurve gets flatter and flatter. At the opposite extreme, demand is perfectly elastic.\\nThis occurs as the price elasticity of demand approaches infinity and the demandcurve becomes horizontal, reflecting the fact that very small changes in the pricelead to huge changes in the quantity demanded.\\nFinally, if you have trouble keeping straight the terms elastic and inelastic,\\nhere’s a memory trick for you: I\\nnelastic curves, such as in panel (a) of Figure 5-1,\\nlook like the letter I. Elastic curves, as in panel (e), look like the letter E.This is not\\na deep insight, but it might help on your next exam.\\nTOTAL REVENUE AND THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND\\nWhen studying changes in supply or demand in a market, one variable we oftenwant to study is total revenue, the amount paid by buyers and received by sellers\\nof the good. In any market, total revenue is P/H11003Q,the price of the good times the\\nquantity of the good sold. We can show total revenue graphically, as in Figure 5-2.The height of the box under the demand curve is P,and the width is Q.The area\\nof this box, P/H11003Q,equals the total revenue in this market. In Figure 5-2, where\\nP/H11005$4 and Q/H11005100, total revenue is $4 /H11003100, or $400.\\nHow does total revenue change as one moves along the demand curve? The\\nanswer depends on the price elasticity of demand. If demand is inelastic, as in Fig-ure 5-3, then an increase in the price causes an increase in total revenue. Here anincrease in price from $1 to $3 causes the quantity demanded to fall only from 100 total revenue\\nthe amount paid by buyers andreceived by sellers of a good,computed as the price of the goodtimes the quantity soldCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 99\\n$4\\nDemand\\nQuantity\\nQP\\n0Price\\nP /H11003 Q /H11005 $400\\n(revenue)\\n100Figure 5-2\\nTOTAL REVENUE .

With an\\ninelastic demand curve, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demandedthat is proportionately smaller. Therefore, total revenue (the product of price and quantity)increases. Here, an increase in the price from $1 to $3 causes the quantity demanded to fall\\nfrom 100 to 80, and total revenue rises from $100 to $240.100 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nto 80, and so total revenue rises from $100 to $240. An increase in price raises\\nP/H11003Qbecause the fall in Qis proportionately smaller than the rise in P.\\nWe obtain the opposite result if demand is elastic: An increase in the price\\ncauses a decrease in total revenue. In Figure 5-4, for instance, when the price risesfrom $4 to $5, the quantity demanded falls from 50 to 20, and so total revenue fallsfrom $200 to $100. Because demand is elastic, the reduction in the quantity de-manded is so great that it more than offsets the increase in the price. That is, an in-crease in price reduces P/H11003Qbecause the fall in Q is proportionately greater than\\nthe rise in P.\\nAlthough the examples in these two figures are extreme, they illustrate a gen-\\neral rule:\\nNWhen a demand curve is inelastic (a price elasticity less than 1), a price\\nincrease raises total revenue, and a price decrease reduces total revenue.\\nNWhen a demand curve is elastic (a price elasticity greater than 1), a price\\nincrease reduces total revenue, and a price decrease raises total revenue.\\nNIn the special case of unit elastic demand (a price elasticity exactly equal\\nto 1), a change in the price does not affect total revenue.\\nDemand\\nQuantity 0Price\\nRevenue /H11005 $200$4\\n50Demand\\nQuantity 0Price\\nRevenue /H11005 $100$5\\n20\\nFigure 5-4HOWTOTAL REVENUE CHANGES WHEN PRICE CHANGES : ELASTIC DEMAND . With an\\nelastic demand curve, an increase in the price leads to a decrease in quantity demandedthat is proportionately larger. Therefore, total revenue (the product of price and quantity)decreases. Here, an increase in the price from $4 to $5 causes the quantity demanded to\\nfall from 50 to 20, so total revenue falls from $200 to $100.CHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 101\\nELASTICITY AND TOTAL REVENUE ALONG\\nA LINEAR DEMAND CURVE\\nAlthough some demand curves have an elasticity that is the same along the entire\\ncurve, that is not always the case. An example of a demand curve along whichelasticity changes is a straight line, as shown in Figure 5-5. A linear demand curvehas a constant slope. Recall that slope is defined as “rise over run,” which here isthe ratio of the change in price (“rise”) to the change in quantity (“run”). This par-ticular demand curve’s slope is constant because each $1 increase in price causesthe same 2-unit decrease in the quantity demanded.56$7\\n4\\n123\\nQuantity12 2468 1 0 1 4 0Price\\nElasticity is\\nlargerthan 1.\\nElasticity is\\nsmallerthan 1.Figure 5-5\\nAL INEAR DEMAND CURVE .\\nThe slope of a linear demandcurve is constant, but its elasticityis not.\\nTable 5-1TOTAL\\nREVENUE PERCENT PERCENT\\n(PRICE/H11547 CHANGE IN CHANGE IN\\nPRICE QUANTITY QUANTITY )P RICE QUANTITY ELASTICITY DESCRIPTION\\n$7 0 $ 015 200 13.0 Elastic62 1 218 67 3.7 Elastic54 2 022 40 1.8 Elastic46 2 429 29 1.0 Unit elastic38 2 440 22 0.6 Inelastic21 0 2 067 18 0.3 Inelastic11 2 1 2200 15 0.1 Inelastic01 4 0\\nCOMPUTING THE ELASTICITY OF A LINEAR DEMAND CURVE\\nNOTE: Elasticity is calculated here using the midpoint method.102 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nCASE STUDY PRICING ADMISSION TO A MUSEUM\\nYou are curator of a major art museum. Your director of finance tells you that\\nthe museum is running short of funds and suggests that you consider chang-ing the price of admission to increase total revenue. What do you do? Do youraise the price of admission, or do you lower it?\\nThe answer depends on the elasticity of demand. If the demand for visits to\\nthe museum is inelastic, then an increase in the price of admission would in-crease total revenue. But if the demand is elastic, then an increase in pricewould cause the number of visitors to fall by so much that total revenue woulddecrease. In this case, you should cut the price. The number of visitors wouldrise by so much that total revenue would increase.\\nTo estimate the price elasticity of demand, you would need to turn to your\\nstatisticians. They might use historical data to study how museum attendancevaried from year to year as the admission price changed. Or they might usedata on attendance at the various museums around the country to see how theadmission price affects attendance. In studying either of these sets of data, thestatisticians would need to take account of other factors that affect attendance—weather, population, size of collection, and so forth—to isolate the effect ofprice. In the end, such data analysis would provide an estimate of the price elas-ticity of demand, which you could use in deciding how to respond to your fi-nancial problem.\\nOTHER DEMAND ELASTICITIES\\nIn addition to the price elasticity of demand, economists also use other elastici-ties to describe the behavior of buyers in a market.\\nThe Income Elasticity of Demand Economists use the income\\nelasticity of demand to measure how the quantity demanded changes as con-\\nsumer income changes. The income elasticity is the percentage change in quan-tity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. That is,Even though the slope of a linear demand curve is constant, the elasticity is\\nnot. The reason is that the slope is the ratio of changes in the two variables, whereas\\nthe elasticity is the ratio of percentage changes in the two variables. You can see this\\nmost easily by looking at Table 5-1. This table shows the demand schedule for thelinear demand curve in Figure 5-5 and calculates the price elasticity of demandusing the midpoint method discussed earlier. At points with a low price and highquantity, the demand curve is inelastic. At points with a high price and low quan-tity, the demand curve is elastic.\\nTable 5-1 also presents total revenue at each point on the demand curve. These\\nnumbers illustrate the relationship between total revenue and elasticity. When theprice is $1, for instance, demand is inelastic, and a price increase to $2 raises totalrevenue. When the price is $5, demand is elastic, and a price increase to $6 reducestotal revenue. Between $3 and $4, demand is exactly unit elastic, and total revenueis the same at these two prices.\\nIF THE PRICE OF ADMISSION WERE HIGHER ,\\nHOW MUCH SHORTER WOULD THIS LINE\\nBECOME ?\\nincome elasticity of\\ndemanda measure of how much the quantitydemanded of a good responds to achange in consumers’ income,computed as the percentage changein quantity demanded divided by thepercentage change in incomeCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 103\\nIncome elasticity of demand /H11005 .\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 4, most goods are normal goods: Higher income raises\\nquantity demanded. Because quantity demanded and income move in the samedirection, normal goods have positive income elasticities. A few goods, such as busPercentage change in quantity demanded\\nPercentage change in incomeHOW SHOULD A FIRM THAT OPERATES A\\nprivate toll road set a price for its ser-\\nvice? As the following article makesclear, answering this question requiresan understanding of the demand curveand its elasticity.\\nFor Whom the Booth Tolls,\\nPrice Really Does Matter\\nBYSTEVEN PEARLSTEIN\\nAll businesses face a similar question:\\nWhat price for their product will generatethe maximum profit?\\nThe answer is not always obvious:\\nRaising the price of something often hasthe effect of reducing sales as price-sensitive consumers seek alternatives orsimply do without. For every product, theextent of that sensitivity is different. Thetrick is to find the point for each wherethe ideal tradeoff between profit marginand sales volume is achieved.\\nRight now, the developers of a new\\nprivate toll road between Leesburg andWashington-Dulles International Airport\\nare trying to discern the magic point. Thegroup originally projected that it couldcharge nearly $2 for the 14-mile one-waytrip, while attracting 34,000 trips on anaverage day from overcrowded publicroads such as nearby Route 7. But afterspending $350 million to build their muchheralded “Greenway,” they discoveredto their dismay that only about a thirdthat number of commuters were willingto pay that much to shave 20 minutes offtheir daily commute. . . .\\nIt was only when the company, in\\ndesperation, lowered the toll to $1 that itcame even close to attracting the ex-pected traffic flows.\\nAlthough the Greenway still is los-\\ning money, it is clearly better off at thisnew point on the demand curve than itwas when it first opened. Average dailyrevenue today is $22,000, comparedwith $14,875 when the “special intro-ductory” price was $1.75. And with traf-fic still light even at rush hour, it ispossible that the owners may lower tollseven further in search of higher revenue.\\nAfter all, when the price was low-\\nered by 45 percent last spring, it gener-ated a 200 percent increase in volumethree months later. If the same ratio ap-plies again, lowering the toll another25 percent would drive the daily volumeup to 38,000 trips, and daily revenue upto nearly $29,000.\\nThe problem, of course, is that the\\nsame ratio usually does not apply atevery price point, which is why this pric-\\ning business is so tricky. . . .\\nClifford Winston of the Brookings\\nInstitution and John Calfee of the Ameri-can Enterprise Institute have consideredthe toll road’s dilemma. . . .\\nLast year, the economists con-\\nducted an elaborate market test with1,170 people across the country whowere each presented with a series of op-tions in which they were, in effect, askedto make a personal tradeoff betweenless commuting time and higher tolls.\\nIn the end, they concluded that the\\npeople who placed the highest value onreducing their commuting time alreadyhad done so by finding public transporta-tion, living closer to their work, or select-ing jobs that allowed them to commuteat off-peak hours.\\nConversely, those who commuted\\nsignificant distances had a higher toler-ance for traffic congestion and were will-ing to pay only 20 percent of their hourlypay to save an hour of their time.\\nOverall, the Winston/Calfee find-\\nings help explain why the Greenway’soriginal toll and volume projections weretoo high: By their reckoning, only com-muters who earned at least $30 an hour(about $60,000 a year) would be willingto pay $2 to save 20 minutes.\\nSOURCE :The Washington Post, October 24, 1996,\\np.

Because\\nquantity demanded and income move in opposite directions, inferior goods havenegative income elasticities.\\nEven among normal goods, income elasticities vary substantially in size. Ne-\\ncessities, such as food and clothing, tend to have small income elasticities becauseconsumers, regardless of how low their incomes, choose to buy some of thesegoods. Luxuries, such as caviar and furs, tend to have large income elasticities be-cause consumers feel that they can do without these goods altogether if their in-come is too low.\\nThe Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand Economists use the cross-\\nprice elasticity of demand to measure how the quantity demanded of one good\\nchanges as the price of another good changes. It is calculated as the percentagechange in quantity demanded of good 1 divided by the percentage change in theprice of good 2. That is,\\nCross-price elasticity of demand /H11005 .\\nWhether the cross-price elasticity is a positive or negative number depends on\\nwhether the two goods are substitutes or complements. As we discussed in Chap-ter 4, substitutes are goods that are typically used in place of one another, such ashamburgers and hot dogs. An increase in hot dog prices induces people to grillhamburgers instead. Because the price of hot dogs and the quantity of hamburgersdemanded move in the same direction, the cross-price elasticity is positive. Con-versely, complements are goods that are typically used together, such as comput-ers and software. In this case, the cross-price elasticity is negative, indicating thatan increase in the price of computers reduces the quantity of software demanded.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define the price elasticity of demand. NExplain the \\nrelationship between total revenue and the price elasticity of demand.\\nTHE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY\\nWhen we discussed the determinants of supply in Chapter 4, we noted that sellers\\nof a good increase the quantity supplied when the price of the good rises, whentheir input prices fall, or when their technology improves. To turn from qualita-tive to quantitative statements about supply, we once again use the concept ofelasticity.\\nTHE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY\\nAND ITS DETERMINANTS\\nThe law of supply states that higher prices raise the quantity supplied. The price\\nelasticity of supply measures how much the quantity supplied responds to\\nchanges in the price.

Supply is said to be inelastic if the\\nquantity supplied responds only slightly to changes in the price.\\nThe price elasticity of supply depends on the flexibility of sellers to change the\\namount of the good they produce. For example, beachfront land has an inelasticsupply because it is almost impossible to produce more of it. By contrast, manu-factured goods, such as books, cars, and televisions, have elastic supplies becausethe firms that produce them can run their factories longer in response to a higherprice.\\nIn most markets, a key determinant of the price elasticity of supply is the time\\nperiod being considered. Supply is usually more elastic in the long run than in theshort run. Over short periods of time, firms cannot easily change the size of theirfactories to make more or less of a good. Thus, in the short run, the quantity sup-plied is not very responsive to the price. By contrast, over longer periods, firms canbuild new factories or close old ones. In addition, new firms can enter a market,and old firms can shut down. Thus, in the long run, the quantity supplied can re-spond substantially to the price.\\nCOMPUTING THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY\\nNow that we have some idea about what the price elasticity of supply is, let’s bemore precise. Economists compute the price elasticity of supply as the percentagechange in the quantity supplied divided by the percentage change in the price.That is,\\nPrice elasticity of supply /H11005 .\\nFor example, suppose that an increase in the price of milk from $2.85 to $3.15 a gal-\\nlon raises the amount that dairy farmers produce from 9,000 to 11,000 gallons permonth. Using the midpoint method, we calculate the percentage change in price as\\nPercentage change in price /H11005(3.15 /H110022.85)/3.00 /H11003100 /H1100510 percent.\\nSimilarly, we calculate the percentage change in quantity supplied as\\nPercentage change in quantity supplied /H11005(11,000 /H110029,000)/10,000 /H11003100\\n/H1100520 percent.\\nIn this case, the price elasticity of supply is\\nPrice elasticity of supply /H11005/H11005 2.0.\\nIn this example, the elasticity of 2 reflects the fact that the quantity supplied moves\\nproportionately twice as much as the price.\\nTHE VARIETY OF SUPPLY CURVES\\nBecause the price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity sup-plied to the price, it is reflected in the appearance of the supply curve. Figure 5-6shows five cases. In the extreme case of a zero elasticity, supply is perfectly inelastic,20 percent\\n10 percentPercentage change in quantity supplied\\nPercentage change in price100 110\\n100 125(a) Perfectly Inelastic Supply: Elasticity Equals 0\\n$5\\n4Supply\\nQuantity 100 0(b) Inelastic Supply: Elasticity Is Less Than 1\\n$5\\n4\\nQuantity 0\\n(c) Unit Elastic Supply: Elasticity Equals 1\\n$5\\n4\\nQuantity 0Price1.

The price elasticity of supply determines whether the\\nsupply curve is steep or flat. Note that all percentage changes are calculated using the\\nmidpoint method.CHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 107\\nand the supply curve is vertical. In this case, the quantity supplied is the same re-\\ngardless of the price. As the elasticity rises, the supply curve gets flatter, whichshows that the quantity supplied responds more to changes in the price. At the op-posite extreme, supply is perfectly elastic. This occurs as the price elasticity of sup-\\nply approaches infinity and the supply curve becomes horizontal, meaning thatvery small changes in the price lead to very large changes in the quantity supplied.\\nIn some markets, the elasticity of supply is not constant but varies over the\\nsupply curve. Figure 5-7 shows a typical case for an industry in which firms havefactories with a limited capacity for production. For low levels of quantity sup-plied, the elasticity of supply is high, indicating that firms respond substantially tochanges in the price. In this region, firms have capacity for production that is notbeing used, such as plants and equipment sitting idle for all or part of the day.Small increases in price make it profitable for firms to begin using this idle capac-ity. As the quantity supplied rises, firms begin to reach capacity. Once capacity isfully used, increasing production further requires the construction of new plants.To induce firms to incur this extra expense, the price must rise substantially, sosupply becomes less elastic.\\nFigure 5-7 presents a numerical example of this phenomenon. When the price\\nrises from $3 to $4 (a 29 percent increase, according to the midpoint method), thequantity supplied rises from 100 to 200 (a 67 percent increase). Because quantitysupplied moves proportionately more than the price, the supply curve has elastic-ity greater than 1. By contrast, when the price rises from $12 to $15 (a 22 percent in-crease), the quantity supplied rises from 500 to 525 (a 5 percent increase). In thiscase, quantity supplied moves proportionately less than the price, so the elasticityis less than 1.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define the price elasticity of supply.

Because\\nfirms often have a maximumcapacity for production, theelasticity of supply may be veryhigh at low levels of quantitysupplied and very low at highlevels of quantity supplied. Here,an increase in price from $3 to $4increases the quantity suppliedfrom 100 to 200. Because theincrease in quantity supplied of67 percent is larger than theincrease in price of 29 percent, thesupply curve is elastic in thisrange. By contrast, when theprice rises from $12 to $15, thequantity supplied rises only from500 to 525. Because the increase inquantity supplied of 5 percent issmaller than the increase in priceof 22 percent, the supply curve isinelastic in this range.108 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nTHREE APPLICATIONS OF SUPPLY,\\nDEMAND, AND ELASTICITY\\nCan good news for farming be bad news for farmers? Why did the Organization of\\nPetroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) fail to keep the price of oil high? Doesdrug interdiction increase or decrease drug-related crime? At first, these questionsmight seem to have little in common. Yet all three questions are about markets,and all markets are subject to the forces of supply and demand. Here we apply theversatile tools of supply, demand, and elasticity to answer these seemingly com-plex questions.\\nCAN GOOD NEWS FOR FARMING BE\\nBAD NEWS FOR FARMERS?\\nLet’s now return to the question posed at the beginning of this chapter: What hap-\\npens to wheat farmers and the market for wheat when university agronomists dis-cover a new wheat hybrid that is more productive than existing varieties? Recallfrom Chapter 4 that we answer such questions in three steps. First, we examinewhether the supply curve or demand curve shifts. Second, we consider which di-rection the curve shifts. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to see howthe market equilibrium changes.\\nIn this case, the discovery of the new hybrid affects the supply curve. Because\\nthe hybrid increases the amount of wheat that can be produced on each acre ofland, farmers are now willing to supply more wheat at any given price. In otherwords, the supply curve shifts to the right. The demand curve remains the samebecause consumers’ desire to buy wheat products at any given price is not affectedby the introduction of a new hybrid. Figure 5-8 shows an example of such achange. When the supply curve shifts from S\\n1to S2, the quantity of wheat sold in-\\ncreases from 100 to 110, and the price of wheat falls from $3 to $2.\\nBut does this discovery make farmers better off? As a first cut to answering\\nthis question, consider what happens to the total revenue received by farmers.Farmers’ total revenue is P/H11003Q,the price of the wheat times the quantity sold. The\\ndiscovery affects farmers in two conflicting ways. The hybrid allows farmers toproduce more wheat ( Qrises), but now each bushel of wheat sells for less ( Pfalls).\\nWhether total revenue rises or falls depends on the elasticity of demand. In\\npractice, the demand for basic foodstuffs such as wheat is usually inelastic, forthese items are relatively inexpensive and have few good substitutes. When thedemand curve is inelastic, as it is in Figure 5-8, a decrease in price causes total rev-enue to fall. You can see this in the figure: The price of wheat falls substantially,whereas the quantity of wheat sold rises only slightly. Total revenue falls from$300 to $220. Thus, the discovery of the new hybrid lowers the total revenue thatfarmers receive for the sale of their crops.\\nIf farmers are made worse off by the discovery of this new hybrid, why do\\nthey adopt it? The answer to this question goes to the heart of how competitivemarkets work. Because each farmer is a small part of the market for wheat, he orshe takes the price of wheat as given. For any given price of wheat, it is better toCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 109\\nuse the new hybrid in order to produce and sell more wheat. Yet when all farmers\\ndo this, the supply of wheat rises, the price falls, and farmers are worse off.\\nAlthough this example may at first seem only hypothetical, in fact it helps to\\nexplain a major change in the U.S. economy over the past century. Two hundredyears ago, most Americans lived on farms. Knowledge about farm methods wassufficiently primitive that most of us had to be farmers to produce enough food.Yet, over time, advances in farm technology increased the amount of food thateach farmer could produce. This increase in food supply, together with inelasticfood demand, caused farm revenues to fall, which in turn encouraged people toleave farming.\\nA few numbers show the magnitude of this historic change. As recently as\\n1950, there were 10 million people working on farms in the United States, repre-senting 17 percent of the labor force. In 1998, fewer than 3 million people workedon farms, or 2 percent of the labor force. This change coincided with tremendousadvances in farm productivity: Despite the 70 percent drop in the number of farm-ers, U.S. farms produced more than twice the output of crops and livestock in 1998as they did in 1950.\\nThis analysis of the market for farm products also helps to explain a seeming\\nparadox of public policy: Certain farm programs try to help farmers by inducingthem not to plant crops on all of their land. Why do these programs do this? Theirpurpose is to reduce the supply of farm products and thereby raise prices. With in-elastic demand for their products, farmers as a group receive greater total revenueif they supply a smaller crop to the market. No single farmer would choose toleave his land fallow on his own because each takes the market price as given. Butif all farmers do so together, each of them can be better off.$3\\n2\\nQuantity of Wheat 100 0Price of\\nWheat1.

Improvement in farm technology can be bad for farmers who become in-creasingly unnecessary, but it is surely good for consumers who pay less for food.Similarly, a policy aimed at reducing the supply of farm products may raise the in-comes of farmers, but it does so at the expense of consumers.\\nWHY DID OPEC FAIL TO KEEP THE PRICE OF OIL HIGH?\\nMany of the most disruptive events for the world’s economies over the past sev-eral decades have originated in the world market for oil. In the 1970s members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to raise theworld price of oil in order to increase their incomes. These countries accomplishedthis goal by jointly reducing the amount of oil they supplied. From 1973 to 1974,the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) rose more than 50 percent. Then, afew years later, OPEC did the same thing again. The price of oil rose 14 percent in1979, followed by 34 percent in 1980, and another 34 percent in 1981.\\nYet OPEC found it difficult to maintain a high price. From 1982 to 1985, the\\nprice of oil steadily declined at about 10 percent per year. Dissatisfaction and dis-array soon prevailed among the OPEC countries. In 1986 cooperation amongOPEC members completely broke down, and the price of oil plunged 45 percent.In 1990 the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) was back to where it beganin 1970, and it has stayed at that low level throughout most of the 1990s.\\nThis episode shows how supply and demand can behave differently in the\\nshort run and in the long run. In the short run, both the supply and demand for oilare relatively inelastic. Supply is inelastic because the quantity of known oil re-serves and the capacity for oil extraction cannot be changed quickly. Demand is in-elastic because buying habits do not respond immediately to changes in price.Many drivers with old gas-guzzling cars, for instance, will just pay the higher\\nCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 111\\nprice. Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 5-9 shows, the short-run supply and demand\\ncurves are steep. When the supply of oil shifts from S1to S2, the price increase from\\nP1to P2is large.\\nThe situation is very different in the long run. Over long periods of time, pro-\\nducers of oil outside of OPEC respond to high prices by increasing oil explorationand by building new extraction capacity. Consumers respond with greater conser-vation, for instance by replacing old inefficient cars with newer efficient ones.Thus, as panel (b) of Figure 5-9 shows, the long-run supply and demand curves aremore elastic. In the long run, the shift in the supply curve from S\\n1to S2causes a\\nmuch smaller increase in the price.\\nThis analysis shows why OPEC succeeded in maintaining a high price of oil\\nonly in the short run. When OPEC countries agreed to reduce their production ofoil, they shifted the supply curve to the left. Even though each OPEC member soldless oil, the price rose by so much in the short run that OPEC incomes rose. By con-trast, in the long run when supply and demand are more elastic, the same reduc-tion in supply, measured by the horizontal shift in the supply curve, caused asmaller increase in the price. Thus, OPEC’s coordinated reduction in supplyproved less profitable in the long run.\\nOPEC still exists today, and it has from time to time succeeded at reducing\\nsupply and raising prices. But the price of oil (adjusted for overall inflation) hasP2\\nP1\\nQuantity of Oil 0Price of Oil\\nDemandS2S1(a) The Oil Market in the Short Run\\nP2\\nP1\\nQuantity of Oil 0Price of Oil\\nDemandS2\\nS1(b) The Oil Market in the Long Run\\n2. . . . leads\\nto a largeincreasein price.1.

The cartel now seems to understand\\nthat raising prices is easier in the short run than in the long run.\\nDOES DRUG INTERDICTION INCREASE\\nOR DECREASE DRUG-RELATED CRIME?\\nA persistent problem facing our society is the use of illegal drugs, such as heroin,\\ncocaine, and crack. Drug use has several adverse effects. One is that drug depen-dency can ruin the lives of drug users and their families. Another is that drugaddicts often turn to robbery and other violent crimes to obtain the money neededto support their habit. To discourage the use of illegal drugs, the U.S. govern-ment devotes billions of dollars each year to reduce the flow of drugs into thecountry. Let’s use the tools of supply and demand to examine this policy of druginterdiction.\\nSuppose the government increases the number of federal agents devoted to\\nthe war on drugs. What happens in the market for illegal drugs? As is usual, weanswer this question in three steps. First, we consider whether the supply curve ordemand curve shifts. Second, we consider the direction of the shift. Third, we seehow the shift affects the equilibrium price and quantity.\\nAlthough the purpose of drug interdiction is to reduce drug use, its direct im-\\npact is on the sellers of drugs rather than the buyers. When the government stopssome drugs from entering the country and arrests more smugglers, it raises thecost of selling drugs and, therefore, reduces the quantity of drugs supplied at anygiven price. The demand for drugs—the amount buyers want at any given price—is not changed. As panel (a) of Figure 5-10 shows, interdiction shifts the supplycurve to the left from S\\n1to S2and leaves the demand curve the same. The equilib-\\nrium price of drugs rises from P1to P2, and the equilibrium quantity falls from Q1\\nto Q2. The fall in the equilibrium quantity shows that drug interdiction does re-\\nduce drug use.\\nBut what about the amount of drug-related crime? To answer this question,\\nconsider the total amount that drug users pay for the drugs they buy. Because fewdrug addicts are likely to break their destructive habits in response to a higherprice, it is likely that the demand for drugs is inelastic, as it is drawn in the figure.If demand is inelastic, then an increase in price raises total revenue in the drugmarket. That is, because drug interdiction raises the price of drugs proportionatelymore than it reduces drug use, it raises the total amount of money that drug userspay for drugs. Addicts who already had to steal to support their habits wouldhave an even greater need for quick cash. Thus, drug interdiction could increasedrug-related crime.\\nBecause of this adverse effect of drug interdiction, some analysts argue for al-\\nternative approaches to the drug problem. Rather than trying to reduce the supplyof drugs, policymakers might try to reduce the demand by pursuing a policy ofdrug education. Successful drug education has the effects shown in panel (b) ofFigure 5-10. The demand curve shifts to the left from D\\n1to D2. As a result, the equi-\\nlibrium quantity falls from Q1to Q2, and the equilibrium price falls from P1to P2.\\nTotal revenue, which is price times quantity, also falls. Thus, in contrast to drug in-terdiction, drug education can reduce both drug use and drug-related crime.\\nAdvocates of drug interdiction might argue that the effects of this policy are\\ndifferent in the long run than in the short run, because the elasticity of demandmay depend on the time horizon. The demand for drugs is probably inelastic overCHAPTER 5 ELASTICITY AND ITS APPLICATION 113\\nshort periods of time because higher prices do not substantially affect drug use by\\nestablished addicts. But demand may be more elastic over longer periods of timebecause higher prices would discourage experimentation with drugs among theyoung and, over time, lead to fewer drug addicts. In this case, drug interdic-tion would increase drug-related crime in the short run while decreasing it in thelong run.\\nQUICK QUIZ: How might a drought that destroys half of all farm crops be \\ngood for farmers?

You are now well on your way to becoming an economist (or, at least,\\na well-educated parrot).\\nN The price elasticity of demand measures how much the\\nquantity demanded responds to changes in the price.Demand tends to be more elastic if the good is a luxuryrather than a necessity, if close substitutes are available,if the market is narrowly defined, or if buyers havesubstantial time to react to a price change.\\nN The price elasticity of demand is calculated as the\\npercentage change in quantity demanded divided bythe percentage change in price. If the elasticity is lessthan 1, so that quantity demanded movesproportionately less than the price, demand is said to beinelastic. If the elasticity is greater than 1, so thatquantity demanded moves proportionately more thanthe price, demand is said to be elastic.\\nN Total revenue, the total amount paid for a good, equals\\nthe price of the good times the quantity sold. Forinelastic demand curves, total revenue rises as pricerises. For elastic demand curves, total revenue falls asprice rises.\\nN The income elasticity of demand measures how much\\nthe quantity demanded responds to changes inconsumers’ income. The cross-price elasticity of demand\\nmeasures how much the quantity demanded of onegood responds to the price of another good.\\nN The price elasticity of supply measures how much the\\nquantity supplied responds to changes in the price.

In most markets, supply is more elastic inthe long run than in the short run.\\nN The price elasticity of supply is calculated as the\\npercentage change in quantity supplied divided by thepercentage change in price. If the elasticity is less than 1,so that quantity supplied moves proportionately lessthan the price, supply is said to be inelastic.

The focus of the preceding two chapters has been scien-tific. We have seen how supply and demand determine the price of a good and thequantity of the good sold. We have also seen how various events shift supply anddemand and thereby change the equilibrium price and quantity.\\nThis chapter offers our first look at policy. Here we analyze various types of\\ngovernment policy using only the tools of supply and demand. As you will see,the analysis yields some surprising insights. Policies often have effects that theirarchitects did not intend or anticipate.\\nWe begin by considering policies that directly control prices. For example, rent-\\ncontrol laws dictate a maximum rent that landlords may charge tenants. Minimum-wage laws dictate the lowest wage that firms may pay workers. Price controls areSUPPLY, DEMAND, AND\\nGOVERNMENT POLICIES\\n117118 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nusually enacted when policymakers believe that the market price of a good or ser-\\nvice is unfair to buyers or sellers. Yet, as we will see, these policies can generate in-equities of their own.\\nAfter our discussion of price controls, we next consider the impact of taxes.\\nPolicymakers use taxes both to influence market outcomes and to raise revenue forpublic purposes. Although the prevalence of taxes in our economy is obvious,their effects are not. For example, when the government levies a tax on the amountthat firms pay their workers, do the firms or the workers bear the burden of thetax? The answer is not at all clear—until we apply the powerful tools of supplyand demand.\\nCONTROLS ON PRICES\\nTo see how price controls affect market outcomes, let’s look once again at the mar-ket for ice cream. As we saw in Chapter 4, if ice cream is sold in a competitive mar-ket free of government regulation, the price of ice cream adjusts to balance supplyand demand: At the equilibrium price, the quantity of ice cream that buyers wantto buy exactly equals the quantity that sellers want to sell. To be concrete, supposethe equilibrium price is $3 per cone.\\nNot everyone may be happy with the outcome of this free-market process.\\nLet’s say the American Association of Ice Cream Eaters complains that the $3 priceis too high for everyone to enjoy a cone a day (their recommended diet). Mean-while, the National Organization of Ice Cream Makers complains that the $3price—the result of “cutthroat competition”—is depressing the incomes of itsmembers. Each of these groups lobbies the government to pass laws that alter themarket outcome by directly controlling prices.\\nOf course, because buyers of any good always want a lower price while sellers\\nwant a higher price, the interests of the two groups conflict. If the Ice Cream Eatersare successful in their lobbying, the government imposes a legal maximum on theprice at which ice cream can be sold. Because the price is not allowed to rise abovethis level, the legislated maximum is called a price ceiling. By contrast, if the Ice\\nCream Makers are successful, the government imposes a legal minimum on theprice. Because the price cannot fall below this level, the legislated minimum iscalled a price floor. Let us consider the effects of these policies in turn.\\nHOW PRICE CEILINGS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES\\nWhen the government, moved by the complaints of the Ice Cream Eaters, imposes\\na price ceiling on the market for ice cream, two outcomes are possible. In panel (a)of Figure 6-1, the government imposes a price ceiling of $4 per cone. In this case,because the price that balances supply and demand ($3) is below the ceiling, theprice ceiling is not binding. Market forces naturally move the economy to the equi-\\nlibrium, and the price ceiling has no effect.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 6-1 shows the other, more interesting, possibility. In this case,\\nthe government imposes a price ceiling of $2 per cone. Because the equilibriumprice of $3 is above the price ceiling, the ceiling is a binding constraint on the market.price ceiling\\na legal maximum on the price atwhich a good can be sold\\nprice floor\\na legal minimum on the price atwhich a good can be soldCHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 119\\nThe forces of supply and demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium\\nprice, but when the market price hits the ceiling, it can rise no further. Thus, themarket price equals the price ceiling. At this price, the quantity of ice cream de-manded (125 cones in the figure) exceeds the quantity supplied (75 cones). There isa shortage of ice cream, so some people who want to buy ice cream at the goingprice are unable to.\\nWhen a shortage of ice cream develops because of this price ceiling, some\\nmechanism for rationing ice cream will naturally develop. The mechanism couldbe long lines: Buyers who are willing to arrive early and wait in line get a cone,while those unwilling to wait do not. Alternatively, sellers could ration ice creamaccording to their own personal biases, selling it only to friends, relatives, or mem-bers of their own racial or ethnic group. Notice that even though the price ceilingwas motivated by a desire to help buyers of ice cream, not all buyers benefit fromthe policy. Some buyers do get to pay a lower price, although they may have towait in line to do so, but other buyers cannot get any ice cream at all.\\nThis example in the market for ice cream shows a general result: When the gov-\\nernment imposes a binding price ceiling on a competitive market, a shortage of the goodarises, and sellers must ration the scarce goods among the large number of potential buyers.The rationing mechanisms that develop under price ceilings are rarely desirable.Long lines are inefficient, because they waste buyers’ time. Discrimination accord-ing to seller bias is both inefficient (because the good does not go to the buyer whovalues it most highly) and potentially unfair.

In panel (a), the government imposes a price ceiling\\nof $4. Because the price ceiling is above the equilibrium price of $3, the price ceiling has noeffect, and the market can reach the equilibrium of supply and demand. In thisequilibrium, quantity supplied and quantity demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b),the government imposes a price ceiling of $2. Because the price ceiling is below theequilibrium price of $3, the market price equals $2. At this price, 125 cones are demanded\\nand only 75 are supplied, so there is a shortage of 50 cones.120 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nCASE STUDY LINES AT THE GAS PUMP\\nAs we discussed in the preceding chapter, in 1973 the Organization of Petroleum\\nExporting Countries (OPEC) raised the price of crude oil in world oil markets.Because crude oil is the major input used to make gasoline, the higher oil pricesreduced the supply of gasoline. Long lines at gas stations became commonplace,and motorists often had to wait for hours to buy only a few gallons of gas.\\nWhat was responsible for the long gas lines? Most people blame OPEC.\\nSurely, if OPEC had not raised the price of crude oil, the shortage of gasolinewould not have occurred. Yet economists blame government regulations thatlimited the price oil companies could charge for gasoline.\\nFigure 6-2 shows what happened. As shown in panel (a), before OPEC\\nraised the price of crude oil, the equilibrium price of gasoline P\\n1was below the\\nprice ceiling. The price regulation, therefore, had no effect. When the price ofcrude oil rose, however, the situation changed. The increase in the price of crudein a free, competitive market is both efficient and impersonal. When the market forice cream reaches its equilibrium, anyone who wants to pay the market price canget a cone. Free markets ration goods with prices.\\nWHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS —OPEC\\nORU.S. LAWMAKERS ?\\n(a) The Price Ceiling on Gasoline Is Not Binding\\nQuantity of\\nGasoline0Price of\\nGasoline(b) The Price Ceiling on Gasoline Is Binding\\nP2\\nP1\\nQuantity of\\nGasoline0Price of\\nGasoline\\nQ1 QDDemandS1S2\\nPrice ceiling\\nQS4. . . . resultingin ashortage.3. . . . the priceceiling becomesbinding . . .2. . . . but whensupply falls . . .\\n1.

The difference between quantity\\ndemanded and quantity supplied, QD/H11002QS, measures the gasoline shortage.CHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 121\\noil raised the cost of producing gasoline, and this reduced the supply of gaso-\\nline. As panel (b) shows, the supply curve shifted to the left from S1to S2. In an\\nunregulated market, this shift in supply would have raised the equilibriumprice of gasoline from P\\n1to P2, and no shortage would have resulted. Instead,\\nthe price ceiling prevented the price from rising to the equilibrium level. At theDURING THE SUMMER OF 1999, THE EAST\\ncoast of the United States experienced\\nunusually little rain and a shortage ofwater. The following article suggests away that the shortage could have beenaverted.\\nTrickle-Down Economics\\nBYTERRY L. A NDERSON AND\\nCLAYJ. L ANDRY\\nWater shortages are being blamed onthe drought in the East, but that’s givingMother Nature a bum rap. Certainly thedrought is the immediate cause, but thereal culprit is regulations that don’t allowmarkets and prices to equalize demandand supply.\\nThe similarity between water and\\ngasoline is instructive. The energy crisisof the 1970s, too, was blamed on na-ture’s niggardly supply of oil, but in factit was the actions of the Organizationof Petroleum Exporting Countries, com-bined with price controls, that was themain cause of the shortages. . . .Once again, regulators are respond-\\ning to shortages—in this case of water—with controls and regulations rather thanallowing the market to work. Cities arerestricting water usage; some have evengone so far as to prohibit restaurantsfrom serving water except if the cus-tomer asks for a glass. But althoughcities initially saw declines in water use,some are starting to report increases inconsumption. This has prompted somepolice departments to collect lists of res-idents suspected of wasting water.\\nThere’s a better answer than send-\\ning out the cops. Market forces couldensure plentiful water availability even indrought years. Contrary to popular be-lief, the supply of water is no more fixedthan the supply of oil. Like all resources,water supplies change in response toeconomic growth and to the price. In de-veloping countries, despite populationgrowth, the percentage of people withaccess to safe drinking water has in-creased to 74 percent in 1994 from 44percent in 1980. Rising incomes havegiven those countries the wherewithal tosupply potable water.\\nSupplies also increase when current\\nusers have an incentive to conserve theirsurplus in the marketplace. California’sdrought-emergency water bank illus-trates this. The bank allows farmers tolease water from other users during dryspells. In 1991, the first year the bankwas tried, when the price was $125 peracre-foot (326,000 gallons), supply ex-ceeded demand by two to one. That is,many more people wanted to sell their\\nwater than wanted to buy.\\nData from every corner of the world\\nshow that when cities raise the price ofwater by 10 percent, water use goesdown by as much as 12 percent. Whenthe price of agricultural water goes up10 percent, usage goes down by 20percent. . . .\\nUnfortunately, Eastern water users\\ndo not pay realistic prices for water.According to the American WaterWorks Association, only 2 percent ofmunicipal water suppliers adjust pricesseasonally ....\\nEven more egregious, Eastern water\\nlaws bar people from buying and sellingwater. Just as tradable pollution permitsestablished under the Clean Air Act haveencouraged polluters to find efficientways to reduce emissions, tradable waterrights can encourage conservation and in-crease supplies. It is mainly a matter offollowing the lead of Western watercourts that have quantified water rightsand Western legislatures that have al-lowed trades.\\nBy making water a commodity and\\nunleashing market forces, policymakerscan ensure plentiful water supplies forall. New policies won’t make droughtsdisappear, but they will ease the painthey impose by priming the invisiblepump of water markets.\\nSOURCE : The Wall Street Journal, August 23, 1999,\\np.

Thus, the shift in supply caused a severe shortage at the regulated\\nprice.\\nEventually, the laws regulating the price of gasoline were repealed. Law-\\nmakers came to understand that they were partly responsible for the manyhours Americans lost waiting in line to buy gasoline. Today, when the price ofcrude oil changes, the price of gasoline can adjust to bring supply and demandinto equilibrium.\\nCASE STUDY\\nRENT CONTROL IN THE SHORT\\nRUN AND LONG RUN\\nOne common example of a price ceiling is rent control. In some cities, the local\\ngovernment places a ceiling on rents that landlords may charge their tenants.The goal of this policy is to help the poor by making housing more affordable.Economists often criticize rent control, arguing that it is a highly inefficient wayto help the poor raise their standard of living. One economist called rent control“the best way to destroy a city, other than bombing.”\\nThe adverse effects of rent control are less apparent to the general popula-\\ntion because these effects occur over many years. In the short run, landlords havea fixed number of apartments to rent, and they cannot adjust this numberquickly as market conditions change. Moreover, the number of people searching\\n(a) Rent Control in the Short Run\\n(supply and demand are inelastic)(b) Rent Control in the Long Run\\n(supply and demand are elastic)\\nQuantity of\\nApartments0Supply\\nControlled rent\\nShortageRental\\nPrice of\\nApartment\\n0Rental\\nPrice of\\nApartment\\nQuantity of\\nApartmentsDemandSupply\\nControlled rent\\nShortage\\nDemand\\nFigure 6-3RENT CONTROL IN THE SHORT RUN AND IN THE LONG RUN. Panel (a) shows the short-\\nrun effects of rent control: Because the supply and demand for apartments are relativelyinelastic, the price ceiling imposed by a rent-control law causes only a small shortage ofhousing. Panel (b) shows the long-run effects of rent control: Because the supply and\\ndemand for apartments are more elastic, rent control causes a large shortage.CHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 123\\nfor housing in a city may not be highly responsive to rents in the short run be-\\ncause people take time to adjust their housing arrangements. Therefore, theshort-run supply and demand for housing are relatively inelastic.\\nPanel (a) of Figure 6-3 shows the short-run effects of rent control on the\\nhousing market. As with any price ceiling, rent control causes a shortage. Yetbecause supply and demand are inelastic in the short run, the initial shortagecaused by rent control is small. The primary effect in the short run is to reducerents.\\nThe long-run story is very different because the buyers and sellers of rental\\nhousing respond more to market conditions as time passes. On the supply side,landlords respond to low rents by not building new apartments and by failingto maintain existing ones. On the demand side, low rents encourage people tofind their own apartments (rather than living with their parents or sharingapartments with roommates) and induce more people to move into a city.Therefore, both supply and demand are more elastic in the long run.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 6-3 illustrates the housing market in the long run. When\\nrent control depresses rents below the equilibrium level, the quantity of apart-ments supplied falls substantially, and the quantity of apartments demandedrises substantially. The result is a large shortage of housing.\\nIn cities with rent control, landlords use various mechanisms to ration hous-\\ning. Some landlords keep long waiting lists. Others give a preference to tenantswithout children. Still others discriminate on the basis of race. Sometimes, apart-ments are allocated to those willing to offer under-the-table payments to buildingsuperintendents. In essence, these bribes bring the total price of an apartment (in-cluding the bribe) closer to the equilibrium price.\\nTo understand fully the effects of rent control, we have to remember one of\\nthe Ten Principles of Economics from Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In\\nfree markets, landlords try to keep their buildings clean and safe because desir-able apartments command higher prices. By contrast, when rent control createsshortages and waiting lists, landlords lose their incentive to be responsive totenants’ concerns. Why should a landlord spend his money to maintain andimprove his property when people are waiting to get in as it is? In the end, ten-ants get lower rents, but they also get lower-quality housing.\\nPolicymakers often react to the effects of rent control by imposing additional\\nregulations. For example, there are laws that make racial discrimination in hous-ing illegal and require landlords to provide minimally adequate living condi-tions. These laws, however, are difficult and costly to enforce. By contrast, whenrent control is eliminated and a market for housing is regulated by the forces ofcompetition, such laws are less necessary. In a free market, the price of housingadjusts to eliminate the shortages that give rise to undesirable landlord behavior.\\nHOW PRICE FLOORS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES\\nTo examine the effects of another kind of government price control, let’s return tothe market for ice cream. Imagine now that the government is persuaded by thepleas of the National Organization of Ice Cream Makers. In this case, the govern-ment might institute a price floor. Price floors, like price ceilings, are an attempt bythe government to maintain prices at other than equilibrium levels. Whereas a priceceiling places a legal maximum on prices, a price floor places a legal minimum.\\n124 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nRENT CONTROL REMAINS A TOPIC OF HEATED\\ndebate in New York City, as the follow-\\ning article describes.\\nThreat to End Rent Control\\nStirs Up NYC\\nBYFREDKAPLAN\\nNEWYORK—One recent lunch hour at\\nShopsin’s, a neighborhood diner inManhattan’s West Village, conversationturned to the topic of the state Senatemajority leader, Joseph L.

ForBruno is threatening to take away theirone holy fringe benefit—the eternal rightto a rent-controlled apartment.\\nMassachusetts and California have\\nabolished or scaled back their rent-control laws in recent years, but NewYork remains the last holdout, and on ascale that dwarfs that of the other cities.\\nAbout 2 million residents—more\\nthan a quarter of New York City’s popu-lation—live in apartments covered by\\nregulations that severely limit how mucha landlord can raise the rent and underwhat conditions a tenant or even a ten-ant’s relatives can be evicted.\\nTales are legion of wealthy movie\\nstars, doctors, and stock brokers payinga pittance for palatial dwellings in themore fashionable neighborhoods ofManhattan.\\nSome of these tales were knocked\\noff the books in 1993, when the stateLegislature passed what many called“the Mia Farrow law”—in reference tothe actress who was paying one-fifth themarket price for a 10-room apartment onCentral Park West. Still, the bill did notaffect too many people. It lifted rent con-trols only from apartments going formore than $2,000 a month, and only ifthe tenants’s annual household incomeexceeded $250,000 two years in a row.\\nFar more plentiful are the unaffected\\ncases. An investment banker, who earnsmore than $400,000 a year, pays $1,500a month for a three-bedroom apartmentnear Lincoln Center. A securities trader,making well over $100,000 a year, pays$800 a month for a one-bedroom on theUpper West Side. In both cases, theunits would fetch at least three times asmuch if placed on the open market. . . .\\nBut rent control helps more than the\\nrich. A study by the city concludes thatthe average tenant of a rent-controlledapartment in New York City earns only$20,000 a year. Tenants’ groups say thatending controls would primarily raise therents of those who can least afford topay, resulting in wholesale eviction.\\nHowever, Paul Grogan, president of\\nthe Local Initiatives Support Corp., a pri-vate organization that finances low-income housing, said, “In many poor\\nneighborhoods, the landlord can’t evenget rents as high as the regulationsallow.” . . .\\nFew economists and policy ana-\\nlysts, even liberal ones, support rentcontrol—not so much because it letsrich people pay far less than they can af-ford, but because it distorts the market-place for everyone.\\nFrank Roconi, director of the Citi-\\nzens Housing and Planning Council, apublic-policy research organization thatsupports some government interventionin the real-estate market, spelled out“the classic case” of this distortion:\\n“There is an elderly couple, their\\nkids are gone, they have a three-bedroom apartment, and they are paying$400 a month. Down the hall, there is ayoung family with two kids living in a one-bedroom for $1,000 a month. In a ratio-nal price system, the elderly couplewould have an incentive to move to asmaller, cheaper apartment, leaving va-cant a larger space for the young family.”\\nUnder the current system, though, if\\nthe elderly couple moves away, their chil-dren can claim the apartment at thesame rent. Or, if it is left vacant, the land-lord, by law, can charge only a few per-centage points more than if the tenanthad stayed.\\nTherefore, Roconi noted, “the land-\\nlord isn’t going to let just anybody in.He’s going to let his brother-in-law havethe apartment or his accountant orsomeone willing to give him a bribe.There’s a tremendous incentive for thatapartment never to hit the open market.”\\nSOURCE :The Boston Globe, April 28, 1997, p. A1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nRent Control in \\nNew York CityCHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 125\\nWhen the government imposes a price floor on the ice-cream market, two out-\\ncomes are possible. If the government imposes a price floor of $2 per cone whenthe equilibrium price is $3, we obtain the outcome in panel (a) of Figure 6-4. In thiscase, because the equilibrium price is above the floor, the price floor is not binding.Market forces naturally move the economy to the equilibrium, and the price floorhas no effect.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 6-4 shows what happens when the government imposes a\\nprice floor of $4 per cone. In this case, because the equilibrium price of $3 is belowthe floor, the price floor is a binding constraint on the market. The forces of supplyand demand tend to move the price toward the equilibrium price, but when themarket price hits the floor, it can fall no further. The market price equals the pricefloor. At this floor, the quantity of ice cream supplied (120 cones) exceeds the quan-tity demanded (80 cones). Some people who want to sell ice cream at the goingprice are unable to. Thus, a binding price floor causes a surplus.\\nJust as price ceilings and shortages can lead to undesirable rationing mecha-\\nnisms, so can price floors and surpluses. In the case of a price floor, some sellersare unable to sell all they want at the market price. The sellers who appeal to thepersonal biases of the buyers, perhaps due to racial or familial ties, are better ableto sell their goods than those who do not. By contrast, in a free market, the priceserves as the rationing mechanism, and sellers can sell all they want at the equilib-rium price.(a) A Price Floor That Is Not Binding\\n$3\\n2\\nQuantity of\\nIce-Cream\\nCones0Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n100\\nEquilibrium\\nquantity(b) A Price Floor That Is Binding\\n$4\\nQuantity of\\nIce-Cream\\nCones0Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\n3Price\\nfloor\\nDemandSupply\\nPrice\\nfloor\\n80\\nQuantity\\ndemanded120\\nQuantity\\nsuppliedEquilibrium\\npriceEquilibrium\\nprice\\nDemandSupply\\nSurplus\\nFigure 6-4AM ARKET WITH A PRICE FLOOR . In panel (a), the government imposes a price floor of\\n$2. Because this is below the equilibrium price of $3, the price floor has no effect. Themarket price adjusts to balance supply and demand. At the equilibrium, quantity suppliedand quantity demanded both equal 100 cones. In panel (b), the government imposes aprice floor of $4, which is above the equilibrium price of $3. Therefore, the market priceequals $4. Because 120 cones are supplied at this price and only 80 are demanded, there is\\na surplus of 40 cones.126 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nCASE STUDY THE MINIMUM WAGE\\nAn important example of a price floor is the minimum wage. Minimum-wage\\nlaws dictate the lowest price for labor that any employer may pay. The U.S.Congress first instituted a minimum wage with the Fair Labor Standards Act of1938 to ensure workers a minimally adequate standard of living. In 1999 theminimum wage according to federal law was $5.15 per hour, and some statelaws imposed higher minimum wages.\\nTo examine the effects of a minimum wage, we must consider the mar-\\nket for labor. Panel (a) of Figure 6-5 shows the labor market which, like allmarkets, is subject to the forces of supply and demand. Workers determinethe supply of labor, and firms determine the demand. If the governmentdoesn’t intervene, the wage normally adjusts to balance labor supply andlabor demand.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 6-5 shows the labor market with a minimum wage. If the\\nminimum wage is above the equilibrium level, as it is here, the quantity of laborsupplied exceeds the quantity demanded. The result is unemployment. Thus,the minimum wage raises the incomes of those workers who have jobs, but itlowers the incomes of those workers who cannot find jobs.\\nTo fully understand the minimum wage, keep in mind that the economy\\ncontains not a single labor market, but many labor markets for different types ofworkers. The impact of the minimum wage depends on the skill and experienceof the worker. Workers with high skills and much experience are not affected,because their equilibrium wages are well above the minimum. For these work-ers, the minimum wage is not binding.\\n(a) A Free Labor Market\\nQuantity of\\nLabor0Wage\\nEquilibrium\\nemployment(b) A Labor Market with a Binding Minimum Wage\\nQuantity of\\nLabor0Wage\\nQuantity\\ndemandedQuantity\\nsuppliedLabor\\nsupply\\nLabor\\ndemandMinimum\\nwageLabor surplus\\n(unemployment)\\nEquilibrium\\nwage\\nLabor\\ndemandLabor\\nsupply\\nFigure 6-5HOW THE MINIMUM WAGE AFFECTS THE LABOR MARKET . Panel (a) shows a labor\\nmarket in which the wage adjusts to balance labor supply and labor demand. Panel (b)shows the impact of a binding minimum wage. Because the minimum wage is a pricefloor, it causes a surplus: The quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.\\nThe result is unemployment.CHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 127\\nThe minimum wage has its greatest impact on the market for teenage labor.\\nThe equilibrium wages of teenagers are low because teenagers are among theleast skilled and least experienced members of the labor force. In addition,teenagers are often willing to accept a lower wage in exchange for on-the-jobtraining. (Some teenagers are willing to work as “interns” for no pay at all. Be-cause internships pay nothing, however, the minimum wage does not apply tothem. If it did, these jobs might not exist.) As a result, the minimum wage ismore often binding for teenagers than for other members of the labor force.\\nMany economists have studied how minimum-wage laws affect the teenage\\nlabor market. These researchers compare the changes in the minimum wage overtime with the changes in teenage employment. Although there is some debateabout how much the minimum wage affects employment, the typical study findsthat a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage depresses teenage employmentbetween 1 and 3 percent. In interpreting this estimate, note that a 10 percent in-crease in the minimum wage does not raise the average wage of teenagers by 10percent. A change in the law does not directly affect those teenagers who are al-ready paid well above the minimum, and enforcement of minimum-wage laws isnot perfect. Thus, the estimated drop in employment of 1 to 3 percent is significant.\\nIn addition to altering the quantity of labor demanded, the minimum wage\\nalso alters the quantity supplied. Because the minimum wage raises the wagethat teenagers can earn, it increases the number of teenagers who choose to lookfor jobs. Studies have found that a higher minimum wage influences whichteenagers are employed. When the minimum wage rises, some teenagers whoare still attending school choose to drop out and take jobs. These new dropoutsdisplace other teenagers who had already dropped out of school and who nowbecome unemployed.\\nThe minimum wage is a frequent topic of political debate. Advocates of the\\nminimum wage view the policy as one way to raise the income of the workingpoor. They correctly point out that workers who earn the minimum wage canafford only a meager standard of living. In 1999, for instance, when the mini-mum wage was $5.15 per hour, two adults working 40 hours a week for everyweek of the year at minimum-wage jobs had a total annual income of only$21,424, which was less than half of the median family income. Many advocatesof the minimum wage admit that it has some adverse effects, including unem-ployment, but they believe that these effects are small and that, all things con-sidered, a higher minimum wage makes the poor better off.\\nOpponents of the minimum wage contend that it is not the best way to\\ncombat poverty. They note that a high minimum wage causes unemployment,encourages teenagers to drop out of school, and prevents some unskilled work-ers from getting the on-the-job training they need. Moreover, opponents of theminimum wage point out that the minimum wage is a poorly targeted policy.Not all minimum-wage workers are heads of households trying to help theirfamilies escape poverty. In fact, fewer than a third of minimum-wage earnersare in families with incomes below the poverty line. Many are teenagers frommiddle-class homes working at part-time jobs for extra spending money.\\nEVALUATING PRICE CONTROLS\\nOne of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are\\nusually a good way to organize economic activity. This principle explains why\\n128 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\neconomists usually oppose price ceilings and price floors. To economists, prices are\\nnot the outcome of some haphazard process. Prices, they contend, are the result of themillions of business and consumer decisions that lie behind the supply and demandcurves. Prices have the crucial job of balancing supply and demand and, thereby, co-ordinating economic activity. When policymakers set prices by legal decree, they ob-scure the signals that normally guide the allocation of society’s resources.\\nAnother one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that governments can some-\\ntimes improve market outcomes. Indeed, policymakers are led to control prices be-cause they view the market’s outcome as unfair. Price controls are often aimed athelping the poor. For instance, rent-control laws try to make housing affordable foreveryone, and minimum-wage laws try to help people escape poverty.\\nYet price controls often hurt those they are trying to help. Rent control may\\nkeep rents low, but it also discourages landlords from maintaining their buildingsand makes housing hard to find. Minimum-wage laws may raise the incomes ofsome workers, but they also cause other workers to be unemployed.\\nHelping those in need can be accomplished in ways other than controlling prices.\\nFor instance, the government can make housing more affordable by paying a fractionof the rent for poor families. Unlike rent control, such rent subsidies do not reduce thequantity of housing supplied and, therefore, do not lead to housing shortages. Simi-larly, wage subsidies raise the living standards of the working poor without discour-aging firms from hiring them. An example of a wage subsidy is the earned income tax\\ncredit, a government program that supplements the incomes of low-wage workers.\\nAlthough these alternative policies are often better than price controls, they are\\nnot perfect. Rent and wage subsidies cost the government money and, therefore,require higher taxes. As we see in the next section, taxation has costs of its own.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define price ceiling and price floor, and give an example of \\neach. Which leads to a shortage? Which leads to a surplus? Why?\\nTAXES\\nAll governments—from the federal government in Washington, D.C., to the local\\ngovernments in small towns—use taxes to raise revenue for public projects, suchas roads, schools, and national defense. Because taxes are such an important pol-icy instrument, and because they affect our lives in many ways, the study of taxesis a topic to which we return several times throughout this book. In this section webegin our study of how taxes affect the economy.\\nTo set the stage for our analysis, imagine that a local government decides to\\nhold an annual ice-cream celebration—with a parade, fireworks, and speeches bytown officials. To raise revenue to pay for the event, it decides to place a $0.50 taxon the sale of ice-cream cones. When the plan is announced, our two lobbyinggroups swing into action. The National Organization of Ice Cream Makers claimsthat its members are struggling to survive in a competitive market, and it arguesthat buyers of ice cream should have to pay the tax. The American Association of\\nIce Cream Eaters claims that consumers of ice cream are having trouble makingends meet, and it argues that sellers of ice cream should pay the tax. The town\\nmayor, hoping to reach a compromise, suggests that half the tax be paid by thebuyers and half be paid by the sellers.\\nCHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 129\\nTo analyze these proposals, we need to address a simple but subtle question:\\nWhen the government levies a tax on a good, who bears the burden of the tax? Thepeople buying the good? The people selling the good? Or, if buyers and sellersshare the tax burden, what determines how the burden is divided? Can the gov-ernment simply legislate the division of the burden, as the mayor is suggesting, oris the division determined by more fundamental forces in the economy? Econo-mists use the term tax incidence to refer to these questions about the distribution\\nof a tax burden. As we will see, we can learn some surprising lessons about tax in-cidence just by applying the tools of supply and demand.\\nHOW TAXES ON BUYERS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES\\nWe first consider a tax levied on buyers of a good. Suppose, for instance, that ourlocal government passes a law requiring buyers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 tothe government for each ice-cream cone they buy. How does this law affect thebuyers and sellers of ice cream? To answer this question, we can follow the threesteps in Chapter 4 for analyzing supply and demand: (1) We decide whether thelaw affects the supply curve or demand curve. (2) We decide which way the curveshifts. (3) We examine how the shift affects the equilibrium.\\nThe initial impact of the tax is on the demand for ice cream. The supply curve\\nis not affected because, for any given price of ice cream, sellers have the same in-centive to provide ice cream to the market. By contrast, buyers now have to pay atax to the government (as well as the price to the sellers) whenever they buy icecream. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve for ice cream.\\nThe direction of the shift is easy to determine. Because the tax on buyers\\nmakes buying ice cream less attractive, buyers demand a smaller quantity of icecream at every price. As a result, the demand curve shifts to the left (or, equiva-lently, downward), as shown in Figure 6-6.tax incidence\\nthe study of who bears the burdenof taxation\\n$3.30\\n3.00\\n2.80\\nQuantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones0Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\nPrice\\nwithout\\ntax\\nPrice\\nsellers\\nreceive\\n10090Equilibrium\\nwith taxEquilibrium without taxTax ($0.50)Price\\nbuyers\\npay\\nD1\\nD2Supply, S1\\nA tax on buyersshifts the demandcurve downwardby the size ofthe tax ($0.50).Figure 6-6\\nAT AX ON BUYERS . When a tax\\nof $0.50 is levied on buyers, thedemand curve shifts down by$0.50 from D\\n1to D2. The\\nequilibrium quantity falls from100 to 90 cones. The price thatsellers receive falls from $3.00 to$2.80. The price that buyers pay(including the tax) rises from$3.00 to $3.30. Even though thetax is levied on buyers, buyersand sellers share the burden ofthe tax.130 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nWe can, in this case, be precise about how much the curve shifts. Because of\\nthe $0.50 tax levied on buyers, the effective price to buyers is now $0.50 higherthan the market price. For example, if the market price of a cone happened to be$2.00, the effective price to buyers would be $2.50. Because buyers look at their to-tal cost including the tax, they demand a quantity of ice cream as if the marketprice were $0.50 higher than it actually is. In other words, to induce buyers to de-mand any given quantity, the market price must now be $0.50 lower to make upfor the effect of the tax. Thus, the tax shifts the demand curve downward from D\\n1to\\nD2by exactly the size of the tax ($0.50).\\nTo see the effect of the tax, we compare the old equilibrium and the new equi-\\nlibrium. You can see in the figure that the equilibrium price of ice cream falls from$3.00 to $2.80 and the equilibrium quantity falls from 100 to 90 cones. Because sell-ers sell less and buyers buy less in the new equilibrium, the tax on ice cream re-duces the size of the ice-cream market.\\nNow let’s return to the question of tax incidence: Who pays the tax? Although\\nbuyers send the entire tax to the government, buyers and sellers share the burden.Because the market price falls from $3.00 to $2.80 when the tax is introduced, sellersreceive $0.20 less for each ice-cream cone than they did without the tax. Thus, thetax makes sellers worse off. Buyers pay sellers a lower price ($2.80), but the effectiveprice including the tax rises from $3.00 before the tax to $3.30 with the tax ($2.80 +$0.50 = $3.30). Thus, the tax also makes buyers worse off.\\nTo sum up, the analysis yields two general lessons:\\nNTaxes discourage market activity. When a good is taxed, the quantity of the\\ngood sold is smaller in the new equilibrium.\\nNBuyers and sellers share the burden of taxes. In the new equilibrium, buyers\\npay more for the good, and sellers receive less.\\nHOW TAXES ON SELLERS AFFECT MARKET OUTCOMES\\nNow consider a tax levied on sellers of a good. Suppose the local governmentpasses a law requiring sellers of ice-cream cones to send $0.50 to the governmentfor each cone they sell. What are the effects of this law?\\nIn this case, the initial impact of the tax is on the supply of ice cream. Because\\nthe tax is not levied on buyers, the quantity of ice cream demanded at any givenprice is the same, so the demand curve does not change. By contrast, the tax on sell-ers raises the cost of selling ice cream, and leads sellers to supply a smaller quantityat every price. The supply curve shifts to the left (or, equivalently, upward).\\nOnce again, we can be precise about the magnitude of the shift. For any mar-\\nket price of ice cream, the effective price to sellers—the amount they get to keep af-ter paying the tax—is $0.50 lower. For example, if the market price of a conehappened to be $2.00, the effective price received by sellers would be $1.50. What-ever the market price, sellers will supply a quantity of ice cream as if the pricewere $0.50 lower than it is. Put differently, to induce sellers to supply any givenquantity, the market price must now be $0.50 higher to compensate for the effect ofthe tax. Thus, as shown in Figure 6-7, the supply curve shifts upward from S\\n1to S2\\nby exactly the size of the tax ($0.50).\\nWhen the market moves from the old to the new equilibrium, the equilibrium\\nprice of ice cream rises from $3.00 to $3.30, and the equilibrium quantity falls fromCHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 131\\nCASE STUDY CAN CONGRESS DISTRIBUTE THE\\nBURDEN OF A PAYROLL TAX?\\nIf you have ever received a paycheck, you probably noticed that taxes were de-\\nducted from the amount you earned. One of these taxes is called FICA, an100 to 90 cones. Once again, the tax reduces the size of the ice-cream market. Andonce again, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax. Because the marketprice rises, buyers pay $0.30 more for each cone than they did before the tax wasenacted. Sellers receive a higher price than they did without the tax, but the effec-tive price (after paying the tax) falls from $3.00 to $2.80.\\nComparing Figures 6-6 and 6-7 leads to a surprising conclusion: Taxes on buy-\\ners and taxes on sellers are equivalent. In both cases, the tax places a wedge between\\nthe price that buyers pay and the price that sellers receive. The wedge between thebuyers’ price and the sellers’ price is the same, regardless of whether the tax islevied on buyers or sellers. In either case, the wedge shifts the relative position ofthe supply and demand curves. In the new equilibrium, buyers and sellers sharethe burden of the tax. The only difference between taxes on buyers and taxes onsellers is who sends the money to the government.\\nThe equivalence of these two taxes is perhaps easier to understand if we imag-\\nine that the government collects the $0.50 ice-cream tax in a bowl on the counter ofeach ice-cream store. When the government levies the tax on buyers, the buyer is re-quired to place $0.50 in the bowl every time a cone is bought. When the governmentlevies the tax on sellers, the seller is required to place $0.50 in the bowl after the saleof each cone. Whether the $0.50 goes directly from the buyer’s pocket into the bowl,or indirectly from the buyer’s pocket into the seller’s hand and then into the bowl,does not matter. Once the market reaches its new equilibrium, buyers and sellersshare the burden, regardless of how the tax is levied.$3.30\\n3.00\\n2.80\\nQuantity of\\nIce-Cream Cones0Price of\\nIce-Cream\\nCone\\nPrice\\nwithout\\ntax\\nPrice\\nsellers\\nreceive\\n10090Equilibrium\\nwith tax\\nEquilibrium without taxTax ($0.50)Price\\nbuyers\\npayS1S2\\nDemand, D1A tax on sellersshifts the supplycurve upwardby the amount ofthe tax ($0.50).Figure 6-7\\nAT AX ON SELLERS .

The federal government\\nuses the revenue from the FICA tax to pay for Social Security and Medicare, theincome support and health care programs for the elderly. FICA is an example ofa payroll tax, which is a tax on the wages that firms pay their workers. In 1999,\\nthe total FICA tax for the typical worker was 15.3 percent of earnings.\\nWho do you think bears the burden of this payroll tax—firms or workers?\\nWhen Congress passed this legislation, it attempted to mandate a division ofthe tax burden. According to the law, half of the tax is paid by firms, and half ispaid by workers. That is, half of the tax is paid out of firm revenue, and half isdeducted from workers’ paychecks. The amount that shows up as a deductionon your pay stub is the worker contribution.\\nOur analysis of tax incidence, however, shows that lawmakers cannot so\\neasily distribute the burden of a tax. To illustrate, we can analyze a payroll taxas merely a tax on a good, where the good is labor and the price is the wage. Thekey feature of the payroll tax is that it places a wedge between the wage thatfirms pay and the wage that workers receive. Figure 6-8 shows the outcome.When a payroll tax is enacted, the wage received by workers falls, and the wagepaid by firms rises. In the end, workers and firms share the burden of the tax,much as the legislation requires. Yet this division of the tax burden betweenworkers and firms has nothing to do with the legislated division: The divisionof the burden in Figure 6-8 is not necessarily fifty-fifty, and the same outcomewould prevail if the law levied the entire tax on workers or if it levied the entiretax on firms.\\nThis example shows that the most basic lesson of tax incidence is often\\noverlooked in public debate. Lawmakers can decide whether a tax comes fromthe buyer’s pocket or from the seller’s, but they cannot legislate the true burdenof a tax. Rather, tax incidence depends on the forces of supply and demand.\\nWage without tax\\nQuantity\\nof Labor0Wage\\n Labor demandLabor supply\\nTax wedge\\nWage workers\\nreceiveWage firms payFigure 6-8\\nAP AYROLL TAX. A payroll tax\\nplaces a wedge between the wagethat workers receive and thewage that firms pay. Comparingwages with and without the tax,you can see that workers andfirms share the tax burden. Thisdivision of the tax burdenbetween workers and firms doesnot depend on whether thegovernment levies the tax onworkers, levies the tax on firms,or divides the tax equallybetween the two groups.CHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 133\\nELASTICITY AND TAX INCIDENCE\\nWhen a good is taxed, buyers and sellers of the good share the burden of the tax.\\nBut how exactly is the tax burden divided? Only rarely will it be shared equally. Tosee how the burden is divided, consider the impact of taxation in the two marketsin Figure 6-9. In both cases, the figure shows the initial demand curve, the initialsupply curve, and a tax that drives a wedge between the amount paid by buyersand the amount received by sellers. (Not drawn in either panel of the figure is thenew supply or demand curve. Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax islevied on buyers or sellers.

In panel (b),the supply curve is inelastic, andthe demand curve is elastic. Inthis case, the price received bysellers falls substantially, whilethe price paid by buyers risesonly slightly. Thus, sellers bearmost of the burden of the tax.134 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nCASE STUDY WHO PAYS THE LUXURY TAX?\\nIn 1990, Congress adopted a new luxury tax on items such as yachts, private air-\\nplanes, furs, jewelry, and expensive cars. The goal of the tax was to raise rev-enue from those who could most easily afford to pay. Because only the richcould afford to buy such extravagances, taxing luxuries seemed a logical way oftaxing the rich.\\nYet, when the forces of supply and demand took over, the outcome was\\nquite different from what Congress intended. Consider, for example, the marketfor yachts. The demand for yachts is quite elastic. A millionaire can easily notbuy a yacht; she can use the money to buy a bigger house, take a European va-cation, or leave a larger bequest to her heirs. By contrast, the supply of yachts isrelatively inelastic, at least in the short run. Yacht factories are not easily con-verted to alternative uses, and workers who build yachts are not eager tochange careers in response to changing market conditions.\\nOur analysis makes a clear prediction in this case. With elastic demand and\\ninelastic supply, the burden of a tax falls largely on the suppliers. That is, a taxon yachts places a burden largely on the firms and workers who build yachtsbecause they end up getting a lower price for their product. The workers, how-ever, are not wealthy. Thus, the burden of a luxury tax falls more on the middleclass than on the rich.the tax.) The difference in the two panels is the relative elasticity of supply anddemand.\\nPanel (a) of Figure 6-9 shows a tax in a market with very elastic supply and rel-\\natively inelastic demand. That is, sellers are very responsive to the price of thegood, whereas buyers are not very responsive. When a tax is imposed on a marketwith these elasticities, the price received by sellers does not fall much, so sellersbear only a small burden. By contrast, the price paid by buyers rises substantially,indicating that buyers bear most of the burden of the tax.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 6-9 shows a tax in a market with relatively inelastic supply\\nand very elastic demand. In this case, sellers are not very responsive to the price,while buyers are very responsive. The figure shows that when a tax is imposed,the price paid by buyers does not rise much, while the price received by sellersfalls substantially. Thus, sellers bear most of the burden of the tax.\\nThe two panels of Figure 6-9 show a general lesson about how the burden of a\\ntax is divided: A tax burden falls more heavily on the side of the market that is less elas-\\ntic.Why is this true? In essence, the elasticity measures the willingness of buyers\\nor sellers to leave the market when conditions become unfavorable. A small elas-ticity of demand means that buyers do not have good alternatives to consumingthis particular good. A small elasticity of supply means that sellers do not havegood alternatives to producing this particular good. When the good is taxed, theside of the market with fewer good alternatives cannot easily leave the market andmust, therefore, bear more of the burden of the tax.\\nWe can apply this logic to the payroll tax, which was discussed in the previous\\ncase study. Most labor economists believe that the supply of labor is much lesselastic than the demand. This means that workers, rather than firms, bear most ofthe burden of the payroll tax. In other words, the distribution of the tax burden isnot at all close to the fifty-fifty split that lawmakers intended.\\n“IF THIS BOAT WERE ANY MORE\\nEXPENSIVE , WE WOULD BE PLAYING GOLF .”\\nCHAPTER 6 SUPPLY, DEMAND, AND GOVERNMENT POLICIES 135\\nThe mistaken assumptions about the incidence of the luxury tax quickly be-\\ncame apparent after the tax went into effect. Suppliers of luxuries made theircongressional representatives well aware of the economic hardship they experi-enced, and Congress repealed most of the luxury tax in 1993.\\nQUICK QUIZ: In a supply-and-demand diagram, show how a tax on car \\nbuyers of $1,000 per car affects the quantity of cars sold and the price of cars. \\nIn another diagram, show how a tax on car sellers of $1,000 per car affects the\\nquantity of cars sold and the price of cars. In both of your  diagrams, show the\\nchange in the price paid by car buyers and the change in price received by car \\nsellers.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe economy is governed by two kinds of laws: the laws of supply and demandand the laws enacted by governments. In this chapter we have begun to see howthese laws interact. Price controls and taxes are common in various markets in theeconomy, and their effects are frequently debated in the press and among policy-makers. Even a little bit of economic knowledge can go a long way toward under-standing and evaluating these policies.\\nIn subsequent chapters we will analyze many government policies in greater\\ndetail. We will examine the effects of taxation more fully, and we will consider abroader range of policies than we considered here. Yet the basic lessons of thischapter will not change: When analyzing government policies, supply and de-mand are the first and most useful tools of analysis.\\nN A price ceiling is a legal maximum on the price of a\\ngood or service. An example is rent control. If the priceceiling is below the equilibrium price, the quantitydemanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Because ofthe resulting shortage, sellers must in some way rationthe good or service among buyers.\\nN A price floor is a legal minimum on the price of a good\\nor service. An example is the minimum wage. If theprice floor is above the equilibrium price, the quantitysupplied exceeds the quantity demanded. Because ofthe resulting surplus, buyers’ demands for the good orservice must in some way be rationed among sellers.\\nN When the government levies a tax on a good, the\\nequilibrium quantity of the good falls. That is, a tax on amarket shrinks the size of the market.N A tax on a good places a wedge between the price paid\\nby buyers and the price received by sellers. When themarket moves to the new equilibrium, buyers pay morefor the good and sellers receive less for it. In this sense,buyers and sellers share the tax burden. The incidenceof a tax does not depend on whether the tax is levied onbuyers or sellers.\\nN The incidence of a tax depends on the price elasticities\\nof supply and demand. The burden tends to fall on theside of the market that is less elastic because that side ofthe market can respond less easily to the tax bychanging the quantity bought or sold.\\nSummary136 PART TWO SUPPLY AND DEMAND I: HOW MARKETS WORK\\nprice ceiling, p. 118 price floor, p. 118 tax incidence, p. 129Key Concepts\\n1.

At thesame time, when farmers bring to market the turkeys they have raised, they wishthe price of turkey were even higher. These views are not surprising: Buyers al-ways want to pay less, and sellers always want to get paid more. But is there a“right price” for turkey from the standpoint of society as a whole?\\nIn previous chapters we saw how, in market economies, the forces of supply\\nand demand determine the prices of goods and services and the quantities sold. Sofar, however, we have described the way markets allocate scarce resources withoutdirectly addressing the question of whether these market allocations are desirable.In other words, our analysis has been positive (what is) rather than normative (whatCONSUMERS, PRODUCERS,\\nAND THE EFFICIENCY\\nOF MARKETS\\n141142 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nshould be). We know that the price of turkey adjusts to ensure that the quantity of\\nturkey supplied equals the quantity of turkey demanded. But, at this equilibrium,is the quantity of turkey produced and consumed too small, too large, or justright?\\nIn this chapter we take up the topic of welfare economics, the study of how\\nthe allocation of resources affects economic well-being. We begin by examining thebenefits that buyers and sellers receive from taking part in a market. We then ex-amine how society can make these benefits as large as possible. This analysis leadsto a profound conclusion: The equilibrium of supply and demand in a marketmaximizes the total benefits received by buyers and sellers.\\nAs you may recall from Chapter 1, one of the Ten Principles of Economics is that\\nmarkets are usually a good way to organize economic activity. The study of wel-fare economics explains this principle more fully. It also answers our questionabout the right price of turkey: The price that balances the supply and demand forturkey is, in a particular sense, the best one because it maximizes the total welfareof turkey consumers and turkey producers.\\nCONSUMER SURPLUS\\nWe begin our study of welfare economics by looking at the benefits buyers receivefrom participating in a market.\\nWILLINGNESS TO PAY\\nImagine that you own a mint-condition recording of Elvis Presley’s first album.Because you are not an Elvis Presley fan, you decide to sell it. One way to do so isto hold an auction.\\nFour Elvis fans show up for your auction: John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Each\\nof them would like to own the album, but there is a limit to the amount that eachis willing to pay for it. Table 7-1 shows the maximum price that each of the fourpossible buyers would pay. Each buyer’s maximum is called his willingness to\\npay, and it measures how much that buyer values the good. Each buyer would be\\neager to buy the album at a price less than his willingness to pay, would refuse towelfare economics\\nthe study of how the allocation ofresources affects economic well-being\\nwillingness to pay\\nthe maximum amount that a buyerwill pay for a good\\nTable 7-1\\nFOUR POSSIBLE BUYERS ’\\nWILLINGNESS TO PAYBUYER WILLINGNESS TO PAY\\nJohn $100Paul 80George 70Ringo 50CHAPTER 7 CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS 143\\nbuy the album at a price more than his willingness to pay, and would be indiffer-\\nent about buying the album at a price exactly equal to his willingness to pay.\\nTo sell your album, you begin the bidding at a low price, say $10. Because all\\nfour buyers are willing to pay much more, the price rises quickly. The biddingstops when John bids $80 (or slightly more). At this point, Paul, George, and Ringohave dropped out of the bidding, because they are unwilling to bid any more than$80. John pays you $80 and gets the album. Note that the album has gone to thebuyer who values the album most highly.\\nWhat benefit does John receive from buying the Elvis Presley album? In a\\nsense, John has found a real bargain: He is willing to pay $100 for the album butpays only $80 for it. We say that John receives consumer surplus of $20. Consumer\\nsurplus is the amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the\\nbuyer actually pays for it.\\nConsumer surplus measures the benefit to buyers of participating in a market.\\nIn this example, John receives a $20 benefit from participating in the auction be-cause he pays only $80 for a good he values at $100. Paul, George, and Ringo getno consumer surplus from participating in the auction, because they left withoutthe album and without paying anything.\\nNow consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you had two iden-\\ntical Elvis Presley albums to sell. Again, you auction them off to the four possiblebuyers. To keep things simple, we assume that both albums are to be sold for thesame price and that no buyer is interested in buying more than one album. There-fore, the price rises until two buyers are left.\\nIn this case, the bidding stops when John and Paul bid $70 (or slightly higher).\\nAt this price, John and Paul are each happy to buy an album, and George andRingo are not willing to bid any higher. John and Paul each receive consumer sur-plus equal to his willingness to pay minus the price. John’s consumer surplus is$30, and Paul’s is $10. John’s consumer surplus is higher now than it was previ-ously, because he gets the same album but pays less for it. The total consumer sur-plus in the market is $40.\\nUSING THE DEMAND CURVE TO MEASURE\\nCONSUMER SURPLUS\\nConsumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve for a product. To see how\\nthey are related, let’s continue our example and consider the demand curve forthis rare Elvis Presley album.\\nWe begin by using the willingness to pay of the four possible buyers to find\\nthe demand schedule for the album. Table 7-2 shows the demand schedule thatcorresponds to Table 7-1. If the price is above $100, the quantity demanded in themarket is 0, because no buyer is willing to pay that much. If the price is between$80 and $100, the quantity demanded is 1, because only John is willing to pay sucha high price. If the price is between $70 and $80, the quantity demanded is 2, be-cause both John and Paul are willing to pay the price. We can continue this analy-sis for other prices as well. In this way, the demand schedule is derived from thewillingness to pay of the four possible buyers.\\nFigure 7-1 graphs the demand curve that corresponds to this demand sched-\\nule. Note the relationship between the height of the demand curve and the buyers’willingness to pay. At any quantity, the price given by the demand curve showsconsumer surplus\\na buyer’s willingness to pay minusthe amount the buyer actually pays144 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nthe willingness to pay of the marginal buyer, the buyer who would leave the market\\nfirst if the price were any higher. At a quantity of 4 albums, for instance, the de-mand curve has a height of $50, the price that Ringo (the marginal buyer) is will-ing to pay for an album. At a quantity of 3 albums, the demand curve has a heightof $70, the price that George (who is now the marginal buyer) is willing to pay.\\nBecause the demand curve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, we can also use\\nit to measure consumer surplus. Figure 7-2 uses the demand curve to computeconsumer surplus in our example. In panel (a), the price is $80 (or slightly above),and the quantity demanded is 1. Note that the area above the price and below thedemand curve equals $20. This amount is exactly the consumer surplus we com-puted earlier when only 1 album is sold.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 7-2 shows consumer surplus when the price is $70 (or\\nslightly above). In this case, the area above the price and below the demand curveTable 7-2\\nTHEDEMAND SCHEDULE FOR THE\\nBUYERS IN TABLE 7-1PRICE BUYERS QUANTITY DEMANDED\\nMore than $100 None 0\\n$80 to $100 John 1$70 to $80 John, Paul 2$50 to $70 John, Paul, George 3$50 or less John, Paul, George, Ringo 4\\nPrice of\\nAlbum\\n507080\\n0$100\\nQuantity of\\nAlbumsDemand\\n1 2 3 4John’s willingness to pay\\nPaul’s willingness to pay\\nGeorge’s willingness to pay\\nRingo’s willingness to payFigure 7-1\\nTHEDEMAND CURVE .

This area equals a total of $40. Once again, this amount is theconsumer surplus we computed earlier.\\nThe lesson from this example holds for all demand curves: The area below the\\ndemand curve and above the price measures the consumer surplus in a market. The reason\\nis that the height of the demand curve measures the value buyers place on thegood, as measured by their willingness to pay for it. The difference between thiswillingness to pay and the market price is each buyer’s consumer surplus. Thus,the total area below the demand curve and above the price is the sum of the con-sumer surplus of all buyers in the market for a good or service.(b) Price = $70\\nPrice of\\nAlbum\\n507080\\n0$100\\nDemand\\n1234Total\\nconsumersurplus ($40)(a) Price = $80\\nPrice of\\nAlbum\\n507080\\n0$100\\nDemand\\n1234 Quantity of\\nAlbums\\nQuantity of\\nAlbumsJohn’s consumer surplus ($30)\\nPaul’s consumer surplus ($10)John’s consumer surplus ($20)Figure 7-2\\nMEASURING CONSUMER SURPLUS\\nWITH THE DEMAND CURVE .I n\\npanel (a), the price of the good is$80, and the consumer surplus is$20.

But how much does buyers’ well-being rise inresponse to a lower price? We can use the concept of consumer surplus to answerthis question precisely.\\nFigure 7-3 shows a typical downward-sloping demand curve. Although this\\ndemand curve appears somewhat different in shape from the steplike demandcurves in our previous two figures, the ideas we have just developed applynonetheless: Consumer surplus is the area above the price and below the demandcurve.

In panel\\n(a), the price is P1, the quantity\\ndemanded is Q1, and consumer\\nsurplus equals the area of thetriangle ABC. When the pricefalls from P\\n1to P2, as in panel (b),\\nthe quantity demanded risesfrom Q\\n1to Q2, and the consumer\\nsurplus rises to the area of thetriangle ADF. The increase inconsumer surplus (area BCFD)occurs in part because existingconsumers now pay less (areaBCED) and in part because newconsumers enter the market atthe lower price (area CEF).CHAPTER 7 CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS 147\\nNow suppose that the price falls from P1to P2, as shown in panel (b). The con-\\nsumer surplus now equals area ADF. The increase in consumer surplus attribut-able to the lower price is the area BCFD.\\nThis increase in consumer surplus is composed of two parts. First, those buy-\\ners who were already buying Q\\n1of the good at the higher price P1are better off be-\\ncause they now pay less. The increase in consumer surplus of existing buyers is thereduction in the amount they pay; it equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Sec-ond, some new buyers enter the market because they are now willing to buy thegood at the lower price. As a result, the quantity demanded in the market increasesfrom Q\\n1to Q2. The consumer surplus these newcomers receive is the area of the tri-\\nangle CEF.\\nWHAT DOES CONSUMER SURPLUS MEASURE?\\nOur goal in developing the concept of consumer surplus is to make normativejudgments about the desirability of market outcomes. Now that you have seenwhat consumer surplus is, let’s consider whether it is a good measure of economicwell-being.\\nImagine that you are a policymaker trying to design a good economic system.\\nWould you care about the amount of consumer surplus? Consumer surplus, theamount that buyers are willing to pay for a good minus the amount they actuallypay for it, measures the benefit that buyers receive from a good as the buyers them-\\nselves perceive it. Thus, consumer surplus is a good measure of economic well-being\\nif policymakers want to respect the preferences of buyers.\\nIn some circumstances, policymakers might choose not to care about con-\\nsumer surplus because they do not respect the preferences that drive buyer be-havior. For example, drug addicts are willing to pay a high price for heroin. Yet wewould not say that addicts get a large benefit from being able to buy heroin at alow price (even though addicts might say they do). From the standpoint of society,willingness to pay in this instance is not a good measure of the buyers’ benefit, andconsumer surplus is not a good measure of economic well-being, because addictsare not looking after their own best interests.\\nIn most markets, however, consumer surplus does reflect economic well-\\nbeing. Economists normally presume that buyers are rational when they make de-cisions and that their preferences should be respected. In this case, consumers arethe best judges of how much benefit they receive from the goods they buy.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw a demand curve for turkey. In your diagram, show a \\nprice of turkey and the consumer surplus that results from that price. Explain \\nin words what this consumer surplus measures.\\nPRODUCER SURPLUS\\nWe now turn to the other side of the market and consider the benefits sellers re-\\nceive from participating in a market. As you will see, our analysis of sellers’ wel-fare is similar to our analysis of buyers’ welfare.148 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nCOST AND THE WILLINGNESS TO SELL\\nImagine now that you are a homeowner, and you need to get your house painted.\\nYou turn to four sellers of painting services: Mary, Frida, Georgia, and Grandma.Each painter is willing to do the work for you if the price is right. You decide totake bids from the four painters and auction off the job to the painter who will dothe work for the lowest price.\\nEach painter is willing to take the job if the price she would receive exceeds\\nher cost of doing the work. Here the term cost should be interpreted as the\\npainters’ opportunity cost: It includes the painters’ out-of-pocket expenses (forpaint, brushes, and so on) as well as the value that the painters place on their owntime. Table 7-3 shows each painter’s cost. Because a painter’s cost is the lowestprice she would accept for her work, cost is a measure of her willingness to sell herservices. Each painter would be eager to sell her services at a price greater than hercost, would refuse to sell her services at a price less than her cost, and would be in-different about selling her services at a price exactly equal to her cost.\\nWhen you take bids from the painters, the price might start off high, but it\\nquickly falls as the painters compete for the job. Once Grandma has bid $600 (orslightly less), she is the sole remaining bidder. Grandma is happy to do the job forthis price, because her cost is only $500. Mary, Frida, and Georgia are unwilling todo the job for less than $600. Note that the job goes to the painter who can do thework at the lowest cost.\\nWhat benefit does Grandma receive from getting the job? Because she is will-\\ning to do the work for $500 but gets $600 for doing it, we say that she receives pro-\\nducer surplus of $100. Producer surplus is the amount a seller is paid minus the\\ncost of production. Producer surplus measures the benefit to sellers of participat-ing in a market.\\nNow consider a somewhat different example. Suppose that you have two\\nhouses that need painting. Again, you auction off the jobs to the four painters. Tokeep things simple, let’s assume that no painter is able to paint both houses andthat you will pay the same amount to paint each house. Therefore, the price fallsuntil two painters are left.\\nIn this case, the bidding stops when Georgia and Grandma each offer to do\\nthe job for a price of $800 (or slightly less). At this price, Georgia and Grandmaare willing to do the work, and Mary and Frida are not willing to bid a lowerprice. At a price of $800, Grandma receives producer surplus of $300, and Georgiareceives producer surplus of $200. The total producer surplus in the marketis $500.\\nTable 7-3\\nTHECOSTS OF FOUR POSSIBLE\\nSELLERSSELLER COST\\nMary $900\\nFrida 800Georgia 600Grandma 500cost\\nthe value of everything a seller mustgive up to produce a good\\nproducer surplus\\nthe amount a seller is paid for a goodminus the seller’s costCHAPTER 7 CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS 149\\nUSING THE SUPPLY CURVE TO MEASURE\\nPRODUCER SURPLUS\\nJust as consumer surplus is closely related to the demand curve, producer surplus\\nis closely related to the supply curve. To see how, let’s continue our example.\\nWe begin by using the costs of the four painters to find the supply schedule for\\npainting services. Table 7-4 shows the supply schedule that corresponds to thecosts in Table 7-3. If the price is below $500, none of the four painters is willing todo the job, so the quantity supplied is zero. If the price is between $500 and $600,only Grandma is willing to do the job, so the quantity supplied is 1. If the price isbetween $600 and $800, Grandma and Georgia are willing to do the job, so thequantity supplied is 2, and so on. Thus, the supply schedule is derived from thecosts of the four painters.\\nFigure 7-4 graphs the supply curve that corresponds to this supply schedule.\\nNote that the height of the supply curve is related to the sellers’ costs. At any quan-tity, the price given by the supply curve shows the cost of the marginal seller, the\\nTable 7-4\\nTHESUPPLY SCHEDULE FOR THE\\nSELLERS IN TABLE 7-3PRICE SELLERS QUANTITY SUPPLIED\\n$900 or more Mary, Frida, Georgia, Grandma 4\\n$800 to $900 Frida, Georgia, Grandma 3$600 to $800 Georgia, Grandma 2$500 to $600 Grandma 1Less than $500 None 0\\nPrice of\\nHouse\\nPainting\\n500800$900\\n0 Quantity of\\nHouses Painted600\\n1234Supply\\nMary’s cost\\nFrida’s cost\\nGeorgia’s cost\\nGrandma’s costFigure 7-4\\nTHESUPPLY CURVE . This figure\\ngraphs the supply curve from thesupply schedule in Table 7-4.Note that the height of the supplycurve reflects sellers’ costs.150 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nseller who would leave the market first if the price were any lower. At a quantity\\nof 4 houses, for instance, the supply curve has a height of $900, the cost that Mary(the marginal seller) incurs to provide her painting services. At a quantity of3 houses, the supply curve has a height of $800, the cost that Frida (who is now themarginal seller) incurs.\\nBecause the supply curve reflects sellers’ costs, we can use it to measure pro-\\nducer surplus. Figure 7-5 uses the supply curve to compute producer surplus inour example. In panel (a), we assume that the price is $600. In this case, the quan-tity supplied is 1. Note that the area below the price and above the supply curveequals $100. This amount is exactly the producer surplus we computed earlier forGrandma.\\nPanel (b) of Figure 7-5 shows producer surplus at a price of $800. In this case,\\nthe area below the price and above the supply curve equals the total area of thetwo rectangles. This area equals $500, the producer surplus we computed earlierfor Georgia and Grandma when two houses needed painting.\\nThe lesson from this example applies to all supply curves: The area below the\\nprice and above the supply curve measures the producer surplus in a market. The logic is\\nstraightforward: The height of the supply curve measures sellers’ costs, and thedifference between the price and the cost of production is each seller’s producersurplus. Thus, the total area is the sum of the producer surplus of all sellers.\\nQuantity of\\nHouses PaintedQuantity of\\nHouses PaintedPrice of\\nHouse\\nPainting\\n500800$900\\n0Supply\\n600\\n1234(b) Price = $800\\nPrice of\\nHouse\\nPainting\\n500800$900\\n0600\\n1234(a) Price = $600\\nSupply\\nGrandma’s producer\\nsurplus ($100)Georgia’s producer\\nsurplus ($200)\\nGrandma’s producersurplus ($300)Totalproducersurplus ($500)\\nFigure 7-5MEASURING PRODUCER SURPLUS WITH THE SUPPLY CURVE .

But how much does sellers’ well-being rise in response toa higher price? The concept of producer surplus offers a precise answer to thisquestion.\\nFigure 7-6 shows a typical upward-sloping supply curve. Even though this\\nsupply curve differs in shape from the steplike supply curves in the previous fig-ure, we measure producer surplus in the same way: Producer surplus is the areabelow the price and above the supply curve. In panel (a), the price is P\\n1, and pro-\\nducer surplus is the area of triangle ABC.\\nPanel (b) shows what happens when the price rises from P1to P2. Producer\\nsurplus now equals area ADF. This increase in producer surplus has two parts.First, those sellers who were already selling Q\\n1of the good at the lower price P1are\\nbetter off because they now get more for what they sell. The increase in producersurplus for existing sellers equals the area of the rectangle BCED. Second, somenew sellers enter the market because they are now willing to produce the good atthe higher price, resulting in an increase in the quantity supplied from Q\\n1to Q2.\\nThe producer surplus of these newcomers is the area of the triangle CEF.\\nQuantity(b) Producer Surplus at Price P2 \\nQuantity(a)  Producer Surplus at Price P1 \\nPrice\\n0Supply\\nB\\nAC\\nProducer\\nsurplus\\nQ1Price\\n0P2\\nP1B\\nCP1Supply\\nAD\\nInitial\\nproducer\\nsurplusE\\nF\\nQ1 Q2Producer surplus\\nto new producersAdditional producersurplus to initialproducers\\nFigure 7-6HOW THE PRICE AFFECTS PRODUCER SURPLUS . In panel (a), the price is P1, the quantity\\ndemanded is Q1, and producer surplus equals the area of the triangle ABC. When the\\nprice rises from P1to P2, as in panel (b), the quantity supplied rises from Q1to Q2, and the\\nproducer surplus rises to the area of the triangle ADF. The increase in producer surplus(area BCFD) occurs in part because existing producers now receive more (area BCED) and\\nin part because new producers enter the market at the higher price (area CEF).152 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nAs this analysis shows, we use producer surplus to measure the well-being of\\nsellers in much the same way as we use consumer surplus to measure the well-being of buyers. Because these two measures of economic welfare are so similar, itis natural to use them together. And, indeed, that is exactly what we do in the nextsection.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw a supply curve for turkey. In your diagram, show a \\nprice of turkey and the producer surplus that results from that price. Explain \\nin words what this producer surplus measures.\\nMARKET EFFICIENCY\\nConsumer surplus and producer surplus are the basic tools that economists use to\\nstudy the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market. These tools can help us addressa fundamental economic question: Is the allocation of resources determined by freemarkets in any way desirable?\\nTHE BENEVOLENT SOCIAL PLANNER\\nTo evaluate market outcomes, we introduce into our analysis a new, hypotheticalcharacter, called the benevolent social planner. The benevolent social planner is anall-knowing, all-powerful, well-intentioned dictator. The planner wants to maxi-mize the economic well-being of everyone in society. What do you suppose thisplanner should do? Should he just leave buyers and sellers at the equilibrium thatthey reach naturally on their own? Or can he increase economic well-being byaltering the market outcome in some way?\\nTo answer this question, the planner must first decide how to measure the eco-\\nnomic well-being of a society. One possible measure is the sum of consumer andproducer surplus, which we call total surplus. Consumer surplus is the benefit that\\nbuyers receive from participating in a market, and producer surplus is the benefitthat sellers receive. It is therefore natural to use total surplus as a measure of soci-ety’s economic well-being.\\nTo better understand this measure of economic well-being, recall how we mea-\\nsure consumer and producer surplus. We define consumer surplus as\\nConsumer surplus /H11005Value to buyers /H11002Amount paid by buyers.\\nSimilarly, we define producer surplus as\\nProducer surplus /H11005Amount received by sellers /H11002Cost to sellers.\\nWhen we add consumer and producer surplus together, we obtain\\nTotal surplus /H11005Value to buyers /H11002Amount paid by buyers\\n/H11001Amount received by sellers /H11002Cost to sellers.CHAPTER 7 CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS 153\\nThe amount paid by buyers equals the amount received by sellers, so the middle\\ntwo terms in this expression cancel each other. As a result, we can write total sur-plus as\\nTotal surplus /H11005Value to buyers /H11002Cost to sellers.\\nTotal surplus in a market is the total value to buyers of the goods, as measured by\\ntheir willingness to pay, minus the total cost to sellers of providing those goods.\\nIf an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, we say that the allocation\\nexhibits efficiency. If an allocation is not efficient, then some of the gains from\\ntrade among buyers and sellers are not being realized. For example, an allocationis inefficient if a good is not being produced by the sellers with lowest cost. In thiscase, moving production from a high-cost producer to a low-cost producer willlower the total cost to sellers and raise total surplus. Similarly, an allocation is in-efficient if a good is not being consumed by the buyers who value it most highly.In this case, moving consumption of the good from a buyer with a low valuationto a buyer with a high valuation will raise total surplus.\\nIn addition to efficiency, the social planner might also care about equity —the\\nfairness of the distribution of well-being among the various buyers and sellers. Inessence, the gains from trade in a market are like a pie to be distributed among themarket participants. The question of efficiency is whether the pie is as big as pos-sible. The question of equity is whether the pie is divided fairly. Evaluating theequity of a market outcome is more difficult than evaluating the efficiency.Whereas efficiency is an objective goal that can be judged on strictly positivegrounds, equity involves normative judgments that go beyond economics and en-ter into the realm of political philosophy.\\nIn this chapter we concentrate on efficiency as the social planner’s goal. Keep\\nin mind, however, that real policymakers often care about equity as well. That is,they care about both the size of the economic pie and how the pie gets sliced anddistributed among members of society.\\nEVALUATING THE MARKET EQUILIBRIUM\\nFigure 7-7 shows consumer and producer surplus when a market reaches the equi-librium of supply and demand. Recall that consumer surplus equals the areaabove the price and under the demand curve and producer surplus equals the areabelow the price and above the supply curve. Thus, the total area between the sup-ply and demand curves up to the point of equilibrium represents the total surplusfrom this market.\\nIs this equilibrium allocation of resources efficient? Does it maximize total sur-\\nplus? To answer these questions, keep in mind that when a market is in equilib-rium, the price determines which buyers and sellers participate in the market.Those buyers who value the good more than the price (represented by the segmentAE on the demand curve) choose to buy the good; those buyers who value it lessthan the price (represented by the segment EB) do not. Similarly, those sellerswhose costs are less than the price (represented by the segment CE on the supplycurve) choose to produce and sell the good; those sellers whose costs are greaterthan the price (represented by the segment ED) do not.\\nThese observations lead to two insights about market outcomes:efficiency\\nthe property of a resource allocationof maximizing the total surplusreceived by all members of society\\nequity\\nthe fairness of the distribution ofwell-being among the members ofsociety154 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\n1. Free markets allocate the supply of goods to the buyers who value them\\nmost highly, as measured by their willingness to pay.\\n2. Free markets allocate the demand for goods to the sellers who can produce\\nthem at least cost.\\nThus, given the quantity produced and sold in a market equilibrium, the social\\nplanner cannot increase economic well-being by changing the allocation of con-sumption among buyers or the allocation of production among sellers.\\nBut can the social planner raise total economic well-being by increasing or de-\\ncreasing the quantity of the good? The answer is no, as stated in this third insightabout market outcomes:\\n3. Free markets produce the quantity of goods that maximizes the sum of\\nconsumer and producer surplus.\\nTo see why this is true, consider Figure 7-8. Recall that the demand curve reflects\\nthe value to buyers and that the supply curve reflects the cost to sellers. At quanti-ties below the equilibrium level, the value to buyers exceeds the cost to sellers. Inthis region, increasing the quantity raises total surplus, and it continues to do sountil the quantity reaches the equilibrium level. Beyond the equilibrium quantity,however, the value to buyers is less than the cost to sellers. Producing more thanthe equilibrium quantity would, therefore, lower total surplus.\\nThese three insights about market outcomes tell us that the equilibrium of sup-\\nply and demand maximizes the sum of consumer and producer surplus. In otherwords, the equilibrium outcome is an efficient allocation of resources. The job ofthe benevolent social planner is, therefore, very easy: He can leave the marketPrice\\nEquilibrium\\nprice\\n0 Quantity Equilibrium\\nquantityA\\nSupply\\nCBDemandD\\nProducer\\nsurplusConsumer\\nsurplus\\nEFigure 7-7\\nCONSUMER AND PRODUCER\\nSURPLUS IN THE MARKET\\nEQUILIBRIUM .

This policy of leaving well enough alone goes by\\nthe French expression laissez-faire, which literally translated means “allow them\\nto do.”\\nWe can now better appreciate Adam Smith’s invisible hand of the market-\\nplace, which we first discussed in Chapter 1. The benevolent social planner doesn’tneed to alter the market outcome because the invisible hand has already guidedbuyers and sellers to an allocation of the economy’s resources that maximizes to-tal surplus. This conclusion explains why economists often advocate free marketsas the best way to organize economic activity.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the supply and demand for turkey.

To conclude that markets are efficient, we made\\nseveral assumptions about how markets work. When these assumptions do nothold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer be true.As we close this chapter, let’s consider briefly two of the most important of theseassumptions.\\nFirst, our analysis assumed that markets are perfectly competitive. In the\\nworld, however, competition is sometimes far from perfect. In some markets, a sin-gle buyer or seller (or a small group of them) may be able to control market prices.This ability to influence prices is called market power. Market power can cause mar-\\nkets to be inefficient because it keeps the price and quantity away from the equi-librium of supply and demand.\\nSecond, our analysis assumed that the outcome in a market matters only to the\\nbuyers and sellers in that market. Yet, in the world, the decisions of buyers andIF AN ECONOMY IS TO ALLOCATE ITS SCARCE\\nresources efficiently, goods must get to\\nthose consumers who value them mosthighly. Ticket scalping is one exampleof how markets reach efficient out-comes. Scalpers buy tickets to plays,concerts, and sports events and thensell the tickets at a price above theiroriginal cost. By charging the highestprice the market will bear, scalpers helpensure that consumers with the great-est willingness to pay for the tick-ets actually do get them. In someplaces, however, there is debate overwhether this market activity shouldbe legal.Tickets? Supply Meets\\nDemand on Sidewalk\\nBYJOHNTIERNEY\\nTicket scalping has been very good to\\nKevin Thomas, and he makes no apolo-gies. He sees himself as a classic Amer-ican entrepreneur: a high school dropoutfrom the Bronx who taught himself atrade, works seven nights a week, earns$40,000 a year, and at age twenty-sixhas $75,000 in savings, all by providing apublic service outside New York’s the-aters and sports arenas.\\nHe has just one complaint. “I’ve\\nbeen busted about 30 times in the lastyear,” he said one recent evening, justafter making $280 at a Knicks game.“You learn to deal with it—I give thecops a fake name, and I pay the fineswhen I have to, but I don’t think it’s fair. Ilook at scalping like working as a stock-broker, buying low and selling high. Ifpeople are willing to pay me the money,what kind of problem is that?”\\nIt is a significant problem to public\\nofficials in New York and New Jersey,who are cracking down on street\\nscalpers like Mr. Thomas and on li-censed ticket brokers. Undercover of-ficers are enforcing new restrictionson reselling tickets at marked-upprices,and the attorneys general of thetwo states are pressing well-publicized\\nIN THE NEWS\\nTicket Scalping\\nTHE INVISIBLE HAND AT WORKCHAPTER 7 CONSUMERS, PRODUCERS, AND THE EFFICIENCY OF MARKETS 157\\nsellers sometimes affect people who are not participants in the market at all. Pol-\\nlution is the classic example of a market outcome that affects people not in themarket. Such side effects, called externalities, cause welfare in a market to depend\\non more than just the value to the buyers and the cost to the sellers. Because buy-ers and sellers do not take these side effects into account when deciding how muchto consume and produce, the equilibrium in a market can be inefficient from thestandpoint of society as a whole.\\nMarket power and externalities are examples of a general phenomenon called\\nmarket failure —the inability of some unregulated markets to allocate resources effi-\\nciently. When markets fail, public policy can potentially remedy the problem andincrease economic efficiency. Microeconomists devote much effort to studyingwhen market failure is likely and what sorts of policies are best at correcting mar-ket failures. As you continue your study of economics, you will see that the toolsof welfare economics developed here are readily adapted to that endeavor.\\nDespite the possibility of market failure, the invisible hand of the marketplace\\nis extraordinarily important. In many markets, the assumptions we made in thiscases against more than a dozen ticket\\nbrokers.\\nBut economists tend to see scalp-\\ning from Mr. Thomas’s perspective. Tothem, the governments’ crusade makesabout as much sense as the old cam-paigns by Communist authorities against“profiteering.” Economists argue thatthe restrictions inconvenience the public,reduce the audience for cultural andsports events, waste the police’s time,deprive New York City of tens of millionsof dollars of tax revenue, and actuallydrive up the cost of many tickets.\\n“It is always good politics to pose\\nas defender of the poor by declaring highprices illegal,” says William J. Baumol,the director of the C. V. Starr Center forApplied Economics at New York Univer-sity. “I expect politicians to try to solvethe AIDS crisis by declaring AIDS illegalas well. That would be harmless, be-cause nothing would happen, but whenyou outlaw high prices you create realproblems.”\\nDr. Baumol was one of the econo-\\nmists who came up with the idea of sell-ing same-day Broadway tickets for half\\nprice at the TKTS booth in Times Square,which theater owners thought danger-ously radical when the booth opened in1973. But the owners have profited byfinding a new clientele for tickets thatwould have gone unsold, an illustrationof the free-market tenet that both buyersand sellers ultimately benefit when priceis adjusted to meet demand.\\nEconomists see another illustration\\nof that lesson at the Museum of ModernArt, where people wait in line for up totwo hours to buy tickets for the Matisseexhibit. But there is an alternative on thesidewalk: Scalpers who evade the policehave been selling the $12.50 tickets tothe show at prices ranging from $20to $50.\\n“You don’t have to put a very high\\nvalue on your time to pay $10 or $15 toavoid standing in line for two hours for aMatisse ticket,” said Richard H. Thaler,an economist at Cornell University.“Some people think it’s fairer to makeeveryone stand in line, but that forceseveryone to engage in a totally unpro-ductive activity, and it discriminates in fa-\\nvor of people who have the most freetime. Scalping gives other people achance, too. I can see no justification foroutlawing it.” . . .\\nPoliticians commonly argue that\\nwithout anti-scalping laws, tickets wouldbecome unaffordable to most people,but California has no laws against scalp-ing, and ticket prices there are not noto-riously high. And as much as scalperswould like to inflate prices, only a limitednumber of people are willing to pay $100for a ticket. . . .\\nLegalizing scalping, however, would\\nnot necessarily be good news for every-one. Mr. Thomas, for instance, fears thatthe extra competition might put him outof business. But after 16 years—hestarted at age ten outside of YankeeStadium—he is thinking it might be timefor a change anyway.\\nSOURCE :The New York Times, December 26, 1992,\\np.

In 1776 the anger of the Ameri-\\ncan colonies over British taxes sparked the American Revolution. More than twocenturies later Ronald Reagan was elected president on a platform of large cuts inpersonal income taxes, and during his eight years in the White House the top taxrate on income fell from 70 percent to 28 percent. In 1992 Bill Clinton was electedin part because incumbent George Bush had broken his 1988 campaign promise,“Read my lips: no new taxes.”\\nWe began our study of taxes in Chapter 6. There we saw how a tax on a good\\naffects its price and the quantity sold and how the forces of supply and demand di-vide the burden of a tax between buyers and sellers. In this chapter we extend thisanalysis and look at how taxes affect welfare, the economic well-being of partici-pants in a market.APPLICATION: THE COSTS\\nOF TAXATION\\n161162 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nThe effects of taxes on welfare might at first seem obvious. The government\\nenacts taxes to raise revenue, and that revenue must come out of someone’spocket. As we saw in Chapter 6, both buyers and sellers are worse off when a goodis taxed: A tax raises the price buyers pay and lowers the price sellers receive. Yetto understand fully how taxes affect economic well-being, we must compare thereduced welfare of buyers and sellers to the amount of revenue the governmentraises. The tools of consumer and producer surplus allow us to make this compar-ison. The analysis will show that the costs of taxes to buyers and sellers exceedsthe revenue raised by the government.\\nTHE DEADWEIGHT LOSS OF TAXATION\\nWe begin by recalling one of the surprising lessons from Chapter 6: It does notmatter whether a tax on a good is levied on buyers or sellers of the good. When atax is levied on buyers, the demand curve shifts downward by the size of the tax;when it is levied on sellers, the supply curve shifts upward by that amount. In ei-ther case, when the tax is enacted, the price paid by buyers rises, and the price re-ceived by sellers falls. In the end, buyers and sellers share the burden of the tax,regardless of how it is levied.\\nFigure 8-1 shows these effects. To simplify our discussion, this figure does not\\nshow a shift in either the supply or demand curve, although one curve must shift.Which curve shifts depends on whether the tax is levied on sellers (the supplycurve shifts) or buyers (the demand curve shifts). In this chapter, we can simplifythe graphs by not bothering to show the shift.

Because of this tax wedge, the quantity sold falls below the level that wouldbe sold without a tax. In other words, a tax on a good causes the size of the marketfor the good to shrink. These results should be familiar from Chapter 6.\\nHOW A TAX AFFECTS MARKET PARTICIPANTS\\nNow let’s use the tools of welfare economics to measure the gains and losses froma tax on a good. To do this, we must take into account how the tax affects buyers,sellers, and the government. The benefit received by buyers in a market is mea-sured by consumer surplus—the amount buyers are willing to pay for the goodminus the amount they actually pay for it. The benefit received by sellers in a mar-ket is measured by producer surplus—the amount sellers receive for the good mi-nus their costs. These are precisely the measures of economic welfare we used inChapter 7.\\nWhat about the third interested party, the government? If Tis the size of the\\ntax and Qis the quantity of the good sold, then the government gets total tax rev-\\nenue of T /H11003Q.It can use this tax revenue to provide services, such as roads, police,\\nand public education, or to help the needy. Therefore, to analyze how taxes affecteconomic well-being, we use tax revenue to measure the government’s benefitfrom the tax. Keep in mind, however, that this benefit actually accrues not to gov-ernment but to those on whom the revenue is spent.\\nFigure 8-2 shows that the government’s tax revenue is represented by the rec-\\ntangle between the supply and demand curves. The height of this rectangle is thesize of the tax, T,and the width of the rectangle is the quantity of the good sold,\\nQ.Because a rectangle’s area is its height times its width, this rectangle’s area is\\nT/H11003Q,which equals the tax revenue.Price buyers\\npaySize of tax ( T)\\nQuantity\\nsold ( Q)Tax\\nrevenue\\n(T /H11003 Q )\\nQuantity Quantity\\nwith tax0Price\\nPrice sellers\\nreceive\\nQuantity\\nwithout taxDemandSupplyFigure 8-2\\nTAXREVENUE .

Figure 8-3 shows thesupply-and-demand diagram and marks the key areas with the letters A through F.\\nWithout a tax, the price and quantity are found at the intersection of the supply\\nand demand curves. The price is P\\n1, and the quantity sold is Q1. Because the demand\\ncurve reflects buyers’ willingness to pay, consumer surplus is the area between thedemand curve and the price, A /H11001B /H11001C. Similarly, because the supply curve reflects\\nsellers’ costs, producer surplus is the area between the supply curve and the price,D/H11001E /H11001F. In this case, because there is no tax, tax revenue equals zero.\\nTotal surplus, the sum of consumer and producer surplus, equals the area A /H11001\\nB /H11001C /H11001D /H11001E /H11001F. In other words, as we saw in Chapter 7, total surplus is the\\narea between the supply and demand curves up to the equilibrium quantity. Thefirst column of Table 8-1 summarizes these conclusions.\\n/H11005 PBA\\nFB\\nDC\\nE/H11005 P1\\nQuantity Q2 0Price\\n/H11005 PS\\nQ1DemandSupplyPrice\\nbuyers\\npay\\nPrice\\nwithout tax\\nPrice\\nsellers\\nreceiveFigure 8-3\\nHOW A TAXAFFECTS WELFARE .\\nA tax on a good reducesconsumer surplus (by the areaB/H11001C) and producer surplus (by\\nthe area D /H11001E). Because the fall\\nin producer and consumersurplus exceeds tax revenue (areaB /H11001D), the tax is said to impose a\\ndeadweight loss (area C /H11001E).\\nTable 8-1WITHOUT TAX WITHTAX CHANGE\\nConsumer Surplus A /H11001B /H11001CA /H11002(B /H11001C)\\nProducer Surplus D /H11001E /H11001FF /H11002(D /H11001E)\\nTax Revenue None B /H11001D /H11001(B /H11001D)\\nTotal Surplus A /H11001B /H11001C /H11001D /H11001E /H11001FA /H11001B /H11001D /H11001F /H11002(C /H11001E)\\nCHANGES IN WELFARE FROM A TAX. This table refers to the areas marked in Figure 8-3 to\\nshow how a tax affects the welfare of buyers and sellers in a market.The area C /H11001E shows the fall in total surplus and is the deadweight loss of the tax.CHAPTER 8 APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 165\\nWelfare with a Tax Now consider welfare after the tax is enacted. The price\\npaid by buyers rises from P1to PB, so consumer surplus now equals only area A (the\\narea below the demand curve and above the buyer’s price). The price received bysellers falls from P\\n1to PS, so producer surplus now equals only area F (the area above\\nthe supply curve and below the seller’s price). The quantity sold falls from Q1to Q2,\\nand the government collects tax revenue equal to the area B /H11001D.\\nTo compute total surplus with the tax, we add consumer surplus, producer\\nsurplus, and tax revenue. Thus, we find that total surplus is area A /H11001B /H11001D /H11001F.\\nThe second column of Table 8-1 provides a summary.\\nChanges in Welfare We can now see the effects of the tax by comparing\\nwelfare before and after the tax is enacted. The third column in Table 8-1 shows thechanges. The tax causes consumer surplus to fall by the area B /H11001C and producer\\nsurplus to fall by the area D /H11001E. Tax revenue rises by the area B /H11001D. Not surpris-\\ningly, the tax makes buyers and sellers worse off and the government better off.\\nThe change in total welfare includes the change in consumer surplus (which\\nis negative), the change in producer surplus (which is also negative), and thechange in tax revenue (which is positive). When we add these three pieces to-gether, we find that total surplus in the market falls by the area C /H11001E. Thus, the\\nlosses to buyers and sellers from a tax exceed the revenue raised by the government. The\\nfall in total surplus that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts a mar-ket outcome is called the deadweight loss. The area C /H11001E measures the size of\\nthe deadweight loss.\\nTo understand why taxes impose deadweight losses, recall one of the Ten Prin-\\nciples of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. In Chapter 7 we saw\\nthat markets normally allocate scarce resources efficiently. That is, the equilibriumof supply and demand maximizes the total surplus of buyers and sellers in a mar-ket. When a tax raises the price to buyers and lowers the price to sellers, however,it gives buyers an incentive to consume less and sellers an incentive to produceless than they otherwise would. As buyers and sellers respond to these incentives,the size of the market shrinks below its optimum. Thus, because taxes distort in-centives, they cause markets to allocate resources inefficiently.\\nDEADWEIGHT LOSSES AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE\\nTo gain some intuition for why taxes result in deadweight losses, consider an ex-ample. Imagine that Joe cleans Jane’s house each week for $100. The opportunitycost of Joe’s time is $80, and the value of a clean house to Jane is $120. Thus, Joeand Jane each receive a $20 benefit from their deal. The total surplus of $40 mea-sures the gains from trade in this particular transaction.\\nNow suppose that the government levies a $50 tax on the providers of clean-\\ning services. There is now no price that Jane can pay Joe that will leave both ofthem better off after paying the tax. The most Jane would be willing to pay is $120,but then Joe would be left with only $70 after paying the tax, which is less than his$80 opportunity cost. Conversely, for Joe to receive his opportunity cost of $80,Jane would need to pay $130, which is above the $120 value she places on a cleanhouse. As a result, Jane and Joe cancel their arrangement. Joe goes without the in-come, and Jane lives in a dirtier house.\\nThe tax has made Joe and Jane worse off by a total of $40, because they have\\nlost this amount of surplus. At the same time, the government collects no revenuefrom Joe and Jane because they decide to cancel their arrangement. The $40 is puredeadweight loss\\nthe fall in total surplus that resultsfrom a market distortion, such asa tax\\n166 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\ndeadweight loss: It is a loss to buyers and sellers in a market not offset by an\\nincrease in government revenue. From this example, we can see the ultimatesource of deadweight losses: Taxes cause deadweight losses because they prevent buyers\\nand sellers from realizing some of the gains from trade.\\nThe area of the triangle between the supply and demand curves (area C + E in\\nFigure 8-3) measures these losses. This loss can be seen most easily in Figure 8-4 byrecalling that the demand curve reflects the value of the good to consumers andthat the supply curve reflects the costs of producers. When the tax raises the priceto buyers to P\\nBand lowers the price to sellers to PS, the marginal buyers and sell-\\ners leave the market, so the quantity sold falls from Q1to Q2. Yet, as the figure\\nshows, the value of the good to these buyers still exceeds the cost to these sellers.As in our example with Joe and Jane, the gains from trade—the difference betweenbuyers’ value and sellers’ cost—is less than the tax. Thus, these trades do not getmade once the tax is imposed. The deadweight loss is the surplus lost because thetax discourages these mutually advantageous trades.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the supply and demand curve for cookies.

In the top two panels of Figure 8-5, the demand curve and the size ofthe tax are the same. The only difference in these figures is the elasticity of the sup-ply curve. In panel (a), the supply curve is relatively inelastic: Quantity suppliedresponds only slightly to changes in the price.

In panels (a) and (b), the demand curve and the\\nsize of the tax are the same, but the price elasticity of supply is different. Notice that themore elastic the supply curve, the larger the deadweight loss of the tax. In panels (c) and(d), the supply curve and the size of the tax are the same, but the price elasticity ofdemand is different. Notice that the more elastic the demand curve, the larger the\\ndeadweight loss of the tax.168 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nCASE STUDY THE DEADWEIGHT LOSS DEBATE\\nSupply, demand, elasticity, deadweight loss—all this economic theory is enough\\nto make your head spin. But believe it or not, these ideas go to the heart of a pro-found political question: How big should the government be? The reason the de-bate hinges on these concepts is that the larger the deadweight loss of taxation,the larger the cost of any government program. If taxation entails very large dead-weight losses, then these losses are a strong argument for a leaner governmentthat does less and taxes less. By contrast, if taxes impose only small deadweightlosses, then government programs are less costly than they otherwise might be.\\nSo how big are the deadweight losses of taxation? This is a question about\\nwhich economists disagree. To see the nature of this disagreement, considerthe most important tax in the U.S. economy—the tax on labor. The Social Se-curity tax, the Medicare tax, and, to a large extent, the federal income tax arelabor taxes. Many state governments also tax labor earnings. A labor tax places awedge between the wage that firms pay and the wage that workers receive. If weadd all forms of labor taxes together, the marginal tax rate on labor income—the\\ntax on the last dollar of earnings—is almost 50 percent for many workers.\\nAlthough the size of the labor tax is easy to determine, the deadweight loss\\nof this tax is less straightforward. Economists disagree about whether this 50percent labor tax has a small or a large deadweight loss. This disagreementarises because they hold different views about the elasticity of labor supply.\\nEconomists who argue that labor taxes are not very distorting believe that\\nlabor supply is fairly inelastic. Most people, they claim, would work full-timeregardless of the wage. If so, the labor supply curve is almost vertical, and a taxon labor has a small deadweight loss.\\nEconomists who argue that labor taxes are highly distorting believe that la-\\nbor supply is more elastic. They admit that some groups of workers may supplytheir labor inelastically but claim that many other groups respond more to in-centives. Here are some examples:\\nNMany workers can adjust the number of hours they work—for instance, by\\nworking overtime. The higher the wage, the more hours they choose to work.relatively elastic: Quantity supplied responds substantially to changes in the price.Notice that the deadweight loss, the area of the triangle between the supply anddemand curves, is larger when the supply curve is more elastic.\\nSimilarly, the bottom two panels of Figure 8-5 show how the elasticity of de-\\nmand affects the size of the deadweight loss. Here the supply curve and the size ofthe tax are held constant. In panel (c) the demand curve is relatively inelastic, andthe deadweight loss is small. In panel (d) the demand curve is more elastic, and thedeadweight loss from the tax is larger.\\nThe lesson from this figure is easy to explain. A tax has a deadweight loss be-\\ncause it induces buyers and sellers to change their behavior. The tax raises the pricepaid by buyers, so they consume less. At the same time, the tax lowers the price re-ceived by sellers, so they produce less. Because of these changes in behavior, thesize of the market shrinks below the optimum. The elasticities of supply and de-mand measure how much sellers and buyers respond to the changes in the priceand, therefore, determine how much the tax distorts the market outcome. Hence,the greater the elasticities of supply and demand, the greater the deadweight loss of a tax.CHAPTER 8 APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 169\\nNSome families have second earners—often married women with children—\\nwith some discretion over whether to do unpaid work at home or paidwork in the marketplace. When deciding whether to take a job, these sec-ond earners compare the benefits of being at home (including savings onthe cost of child care) with the wages they could earn.\\nNMany of the elderly can choose when to retire, and their decisions are partly\\nbased on the wage. Once they are retired, the wage determines their incen-tive to work part-time.\\nNSome people consider engaging in illegal economic activity, such as the drug\\ntrade, or working at jobs that pay “under the table” to evade taxes. Econo-mists call this the underground economy. In deciding whether to work in the un-\\nderground economy or at a legitimate job, these potential criminals comparewhat they can earn by breaking the law with the wage they can earn legally.\\nIn each of these cases, the quantity of labor supplied responds to the wage (the\\nprice of labor). Thus, the decisions of these workers are distorted when their la-bor earnings are taxed. Labor taxes encourage workers to work fewer hours,second earners to stay at home, the elderly to retire early, and the unscrupulousto enter the underground economy.\\nThese two views of labor taxation persist to this day. Indeed, whenever you\\nsee two political candidates debating whether the government should providemore services or reduce the tax burden, keep in mind that part of the disagree-ment may rest on different views about the elasticity of labor supply and thedeadweight loss of taxation.“LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE ELASTICITY OF LABORSUPPLY .”\\nQUICK QUIZ: The demand for beer is more elastic than the demand for\\nmilk. Would a tax on beer or a tax on milk have larger deadweight loss? Why?170 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nIs there an ideal tax? Henry\\nGeorge, the nineteenth-centuryAmerican economist and so-cial philosopher, thought so. Inhis 1879 book Progress and\\nPoverty, George argued that\\nthe government should raiseall its revenue from a tax onland. This “single tax” was, heclaimed, both equitable and ef-ficient. George’s ideas won hima large political following, andin 1886 he lost a close race for\\nmayor of New York City (although he finished well ahead ofRepublican candidate Theodore Roosevelt).\\nGeorge’s proposal to tax land was motivated largely\\nby a concern over the distribution of economic well-being.He deplored the “shocking contrast between monstrouswealth and debasing want” and thought landowners bene-fited more than they should from the rapid growth in theoverall economy.\\nGeorge’s arguments for the land tax can be understood\\nusing the tools of modern economics. Consider first supplyand demand in the market for renting land. As immigrationcauses the population to rise and technological progresscauses incomes to grow, the demand for land rises overtime. Yet because the amount of land is fixed, the supply isperfectly inelastic. Rapid increases in demand together withinelastic supply lead to large increases in the equilibriumrents on land, so that economic growth makes rich landown-ers even richer.\\nNow consider the incidence of a tax on land. As we first\\nsaw in Chapter 6, the burden of a tax falls more heavily onthe side of the market that is less elastic. A tax on land takesthis principle to an extreme. Because the elasticity of supplyis zero, the landowners bear the entire burden of the tax.Consider next the\\nquestion of efficiency. Aswe just discussed, thedeadweight loss of a taxdepends on the elastici-ties of supply and de-mand. Again, a tax on landis an extreme case. Be-cause supply is perfectlyinelastic, a tax on landdoes not alter the marketallocation. There is nodeadweight loss, and thegovernment’s tax revenueexactly equals the loss ofthe landowners.\\nAlthough taxing land\\nmay look attractive in the-ory, it is not as straightforward in practice as it may appear.For a tax on land not to distort economic incentives, it mustbe a tax on raw land. Yet the value of land often comes fromimprovements, such as clearing trees, providing sewers,and building roads. Unlike the supply of raw land, the supplyof improvements has an elasticity greater than zero. If aland tax were imposed on improvements, it would distort in-centives. Landowners would respond by devoting fewer re-sources to improving their land.\\nToday, few economists support George’s proposal for a\\nsingle tax on land. Not only is taxing improvements a poten-tial problem, but the tax would not raise enough revenue topay for the much larger government we have today. Yet manyof George’s arguments remain valid. Here is the assess-ment of the eminent economist Milton Friedman a centuryafter George’s book: “In my opinion, the least bad tax is theproperty tax on the unimproved value of land, the HenryGeorge argument of many, many years ago.”\\nHENRYGEORGEFYI\\nHenry George\\nand the\\nLand Tax\\nDEADWEIGHT LOSS AND \\nTAX REVENUE AS TAXES VARY\\nTaxes rarely stay the same for long periods of time. Policymakers in local, state,\\nand federal governments are always considering raising one tax or loweringanother. Here we consider what happens to the deadweight loss and tax revenuewhen the size of a tax changes.\\nFigure 8-6 shows the effects of a small, medium, and large tax, holding con-\\nstant the market’s supply and demand curves. The deadweight loss—the reduc-tion in total surplus that results when the tax reduces the size of a market below\\nCHAPTER 8 APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 171\\nthe optimum—equals the area of the triangle between the supply and demand\\ncurves. For the small tax in panel (a), the area of the deadweight loss triangle isquite small. But as the size of a tax rises in panels (b) and (c), the deadweight lossgrows larger and larger.\\nIndeed, the deadweight loss of a tax rises even more rapidly than the size of\\nthe tax.

He took out a napkin and drew afigure on it to show how tax rates affect tax revenue. It looked much like panel(b) of our Figure 8-7. Laffer then suggested that the United States was on thedownward-sloping side of this curve. Tax rates were so high, he argued, that re-ducing them would actually raise tax revenue.\\nMost economists were skeptical of Laffer’s suggestion. The idea that a cut\\nin tax rates could raise tax revenue was correct as a matter of economic theory,but there was more doubt about whether it would do so in practice. There waslittle evidence for Laffer’s view that U.S. tax rates had in fact reached such ex-treme levels.\\nNonetheless, the Laffer curve (as it became known) captured the imagination\\nof Ronald Reagan. David Stockman, budget director in the first Reagan admin-istration, offers the following story:\\n[Reagan] had once been on the Laffer curve himself. “I came into the Big\\nMoney making pictures during World War II,” he would always say. At thattime the wartime income surtax hit 90 percent. “You could only make fourpictures and then you were in the top bracket,” he would continue. “So weall quit working after four pictures and went off to the country.” High taxrates caused less work. Low tax rates caused more. His experience proved it.\\nWhen Reagan ran for president in 1980, he made cutting taxes part of his plat-\\nform. Reagan argued that taxes were so high that they were discouraging hardwork. He argued that lower taxes would give people the proper incentive towork, which would raise economic well-being and perhaps even tax revenue.Because the cut in tax rates was intended to encourage people to increase thequantity of labor they supplied, the views of Laffer and Reagan became knownas supply-side economics.\\nSubsequent history failed to confirm Laffer’s conjecture that lower tax rates\\nwould raise tax revenue. When Reagan cut taxes after he was elected, the resultof a triangle depends on the square of its size. If we double the size of a tax, for\\ninstance, the base and height of the triangle double, so the deadweight loss rises bya factor of 4. If we triple the size of a tax, the base and height triple, so the dead-weight loss rises by a factor of 9.\\nThe government’s tax revenue is the size of the tax times the amount of the\\ngood sold. As Figure 8-6 shows, tax revenue equals the area of the rectangle be-tween the supply and demand curves. For the small tax in panel (a), tax revenue issmall. As the size of a tax rises from panel (a) to panel (b), tax revenue grows. Butas the size of the tax rises further from panel (b) to panel (c), tax revenue falls be-cause the higher tax drastically reduces the size of the market. For a very large tax,no revenue would be raised, because people would stop buying and selling thegood altogether.\\nFigure 8-7 summarizes these results. In panel (a) we see that as the size of a tax\\nincreases, its deadweight loss quickly gets larger. By contrast, panel (b) shows thattax revenue first rises with the size of the tax; but then, as the tax gets larger, themarket shrinks so much that tax revenue starts to fall.CHAPTER 8 APPLICATION: THE COSTS OF TAXATION 173\\nwas less tax revenue, not more. Revenue from personal income taxes (per per-\\nson, adjusted for inflation) fell by 9 percent from 1980 to 1984, even though av-erage income (per person, adjusted for inflation) grew by 4 percent over thisperiod. The tax cut, together with policymakers’ unwillingness to restrainspending, began a long period during which the government spent more thanit collected in taxes. Throughout Reagan’s two terms in office, and for manyyears thereafter, the government ran large budget deficits.\\nYet Laffer’s argument is not completely without merit. Although an overall\\ncut in tax rates normally reduces revenue, some taxpayers at some times may beon the wrong side of the Laffer curve. In the 1980s, tax revenue collected from therichest Americans, who face the highest tax rates, did rise when their taxes werecut.

In addition, Laffer’s argument may\\nbe more plausible when applied to other countries, where tax rates are muchhigher than in the United States. In Sweden in the early 1980s, for instance, thetypical worker faced a marginal tax rate of about 80 percent. Such a high tax rateprovides a substantial disincentive to work. Studies have suggested that Swedenwould indeed have raised more tax revenue if it had lowered its tax rates.\\nThese ideas arise frequently in political debate. When Bill Clinton moved into\\nthe White House in 1993, he increased the federal income tax rates on high-income taxpayers to about 40 percent. Some economists criticized the policy,arguing that the plan would not yield as much revenue as the Clinton adminis-tration estimated. They claimed that the administration did not fully take intoWORLD LEADERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND\\nthe costs of taxation, even if the world\\nthey’re leading happens to be thefigment of some game designer’simagination.\\nSupply-Side Is a\\nWinning Strategy\\nBYJOHNJ. V ECCHIONE\\nCongress may have given up on cutting\\ntaxes, but there’s one corner of thecountry where supply-side economicsstill rules—the computer screens ofgame enthusiasts.\\nNot all messages from computer\\ngames are antisocial ones. Althoughwe’ve heard a lot recently about gameslike Doom, known as “shooters,” in whatare known as “God games,” a player as-sumes total control of a city, a country, oreven a galaxy, deciding everything frommilitary to economic policy. In SimCity, a\\nplayer runs a beleaguered municipal ad-ministration. In Civilization and its se-quels, the player is the leader of a historicempire, such as Stalinist Russia or Eliza-bethan England, in a scramble for worlddomination. In Master of Orion, a playeris given command of an entire species—whether humans or lizard-like Sakkras—with the goal of conquering the galaxy.\\nOne thing these games have in\\ncommon: Success requires economicgrowth, and that can only be achieved bykeeping taxes low. Tax rates range fromthe edenic zero to the punitive 80%. Withthe proceeds of these taxes the playermust build costly military or police forcesand the infrastructure to support eco-nomic and technological advancement.\\nWhy not simply keep taxes high and\\nmeet all the “societal needs” a despotcould want? Because . . . keeping taxeshigh leads the population to produceless. As tax rates increase there is, atfirst, no easily discernable effect on thepopulace, except perhaps a few frownsand grumbles. But as soon as taxesreach a certain point—10% in somegames, 20% in others—citizens begin torevolt. . . .\\nIn games covering a single city, citi-\\nzens vote with their feet and begin leav-ing town. No new jobs are created, andonce-vibrant downtown areas are left\\nwith little traffic but plenty of crime.

During times of great militaryconflict or bursts of government con-struction, tax rates can be increased fora number of years without too muchdamage to the populace, and revenuesdo increase from the previous year.

Conversely, when Bob Dole challenged Bill\\nClinton in the election of 1996, Dole proposed cutting personal income taxes. Al-though Dole rejected the idea that tax cuts would completely pay for themselves,he did claim that 28 percent of the tax cut would be recouped because lower taxrates would lead to more rapid economic growth. Economists debated whetherDole’s 28 percent projection was reasonable, excessively optimistic, or (as Laffermight suggest) excessively pessimistic.\\nPolicymakers disagree about these issues in part because they disagree\\nabout the size of the relevant elasticities. The more elastic that supply and de-mand are in any market, the more taxes in that market distort behavior, and themore likely it is that a tax cut will raise tax revenue. There is no debate, how-ever, about the general lesson: How much revenue the government gains orloses from a tax change cannot be computed just by looking at tax rates. It alsodepends on how the tax change affects people’s behavior.\\nQUICK QUIZ: If the government doubles the tax on gasoline, can you be \\nsure that revenue from the gasoline tax will rise? Can you be sure that the \\ndeadweight loss from the gasoline tax will rise? Explain.\\nCONCLUSION\\nTaxes, Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, are the price we pay for a civilized soci-\\nety. Indeed, our society cannot exist without some form of taxes. We all expect thegovernment to provide certain services, such as roads, parks, police, and nationaldefense. These public services require tax revenue.\\nThis chapter has shed some light on how high the price of civilized society can\\nbe. One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that markets are\\nusually a good way to organize economic activity. When the government imposestaxes on buyers or sellers of a good, however, society loses some of the benefits ofmarket efficiency. Taxes are costly to market participants not only because taxestransfer resources from those participants to the government, but also becausethey alter incentives and distort market outcomes.\\nN A tax on a good reduces the welfare of buyers and\\nsellers of the good, and the reduction in consumer andproducer surplus usually exceeds the revenue raised bythe government. The fall in total surplus—the sum ofconsumer surplus, producer surplus, and tax revenue—is called the deadweight loss of the tax.\\nN Taxes have deadweight losses because they cause\\nbuyers to consume less and sellers to produce less, andthis change in behavior shrinks the size of the marketbelow the level that maximizes total surplus. Because\\nthe elasticities of supply and demand measure howmuch market participants respond to market conditions,larger elasticities imply larger deadweight losses.\\nN As a tax grows larger, it distorts incentives more, and its\\ndeadweight loss grows larger. Tax revenue first riseswith the size of a tax. Eventually, however, a larger taxreduces tax revenue because it reduces the size of themarket.Summary176 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\n1.

A century ago the textilesand clothing industry was a major part of the U.S. economy, but that is no longerthe case. Faced with foreign competitors that could produce quality goods at lowcost, many U.S. firms found it increasingly difficult to produce and sell textiles andclothing at a profit. As a result, they laid off their workers and shut down their fac-tories. Today, much of the textiles and clothing that Americans consume are im-ported from abroad.\\nThe story of the textiles industry raises important questions for economic pol-\\nicy: How does international trade affect economic well-being? Who gains and wholoses from free trade among countries, and how do the gains compare to thelosses?APPLICATION:\\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE\\n179180 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nChapter 3 introduced the study of international trade by applying the princi-\\nple of comparative advantage. According to this principle, all countries can bene-fit from trading with one another because trade allows each country to specializein doing what it does best. But the analysis in Chapter 3 was incomplete. It did notexplain how the international marketplace achieves these gains from trade or howthe gains are distributed among various economic actors.\\nWe now return to the study of international trade and take up these questions.\\nOver the past several chapters, we have developed many tools for analyzing howmarkets work: supply, demand, equilibrium, consumer surplus, producer surplus,and so on. With these tools we can learn more about the effects of internationaltrade on economic well-being.\\nTHE DETERMINANTS OF TRADE\\nConsider the market for steel. The steel market is well suited to examining thegains and losses from international trade: Steel is made in many countries aroundthe world, and there is much world trade in steel. Moreover, the steel market is onein which policymakers often consider (and sometimes implement) trade restric-tions in order to protect domestic steel producers from foreign competitors. We ex-amine here the steel market in the imaginary country of Isoland.\\nTHE EQUILIBRIUM WITHOUT TRADE\\nAs our story begins, the Isolandian steel market is isolated from the rest of theworld. By government decree, no one in Isoland is allowed to import or exportsteel, and the penalty for violating the decree is so large that no one dares try.\\nBecause there is no international trade, the market for steel in Isoland consists\\nsolely of Isolandian buyers and sellers. As Figure 9-1 shows, the domestic price ad-justs to balance the quantity supplied by domestic sellers and the quantity de-manded by domestic buyers. The figure shows the consumer and producersurplus in the equilibrium without trade. The sum of consumer and producersurplus measures the total benefits that buyers and sellers receive from the steelmarket.\\nNow suppose that, in an election upset, Isoland elects a new president. The\\npresident campaigned on a platform of “change” and promised the voters boldnew ideas. Her first act is to assemble a team of economists to evaluate Isolandiantrade policy. She asks them to report back on three questions:\\nNIf the government allowed Isolandians to import and export steel, what\\nwould happen to the price of steel and the quantity of steel sold in thedomestic steel market?\\nNWho would gain from free trade in steel and who would lose, and would the\\ngains exceed the losses?\\nNShould a tariff (a tax on steel imports) or an import quota (a limit on steel\\nimports) be part of the new trade policy?CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 181\\nAfter reviewing supply and demand in their favorite textbook (this one, of course),\\nthe Isolandian economics team begins its analysis.\\nTHE WORLD PRICE AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE\\nThe first issue our economists take up is whether Isoland is likely to become a steelimporter or a steel exporter. In other words, if free trade were allowed, wouldIsolandians end up buying or selling steel in world markets?\\nTo answer this question, the economists compare the current Isolandian price\\nof steel to the price of steel in other countries. We call the price prevailing in worldmarkets the world price. If the world price of steel is higher than the domestic\\nprice, then Isoland would become an exporter of steel once trade is permitted.Isolandian steel producers would be eager to receive the higher prices availableabroad and would start selling their steel to buyers in other countries. Conversely,if the world price of steel is lower than the domestic price, then Isoland would be-come an importer of steel. Because foreign sellers offer a better price, Isolandiansteel consumers would quickly start buying steel from other countries.\\nIn essence, comparing the world price and the domestic price before trade in-\\ndicates whether Isoland has a comparative advantage in producing steel. The do-mestic price reflects the opportunity cost of steel: It tells us how much anIsolandian must give up to get one unit of steel. If the domestic price is low, thecost of producing steel in Isoland is low, suggesting that Isoland has a comparativeadvantage in producing steel relative to the rest of the world. If the domestic priceis high, then the cost of producing steel in Isoland is high, suggesting that foreigncountries have a comparative advantage in producing steel.Price\\nof Steel\\nEquilibrium\\nprice\\n0 Quantity\\nof SteelEquilibrium\\nquantityDomestic\\nsupply\\nDomestic\\ndemandProducer\\nsurplusConsumer\\nsurplusFigure 9-1\\nTHEEQUILIBRIUM WITHOUT\\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE .

That is, trade is beneficial because it allows each nation to spe-cialize in doing what it does best. By comparing the world price and the domesticprice before trade, we can determine whether Isoland is better or worse at pro-ducing steel than the rest of the world.\\nQUICK QUIZ: The country Autarka does not allow international trade. \\nIn Autarka, you can buy a wool suit for 3 ounces of gold. Meanwhile, in \\nneighboring countries, you can buy the same suit for 2 ounces of gold. If \\nAutarka were to allow free trade, would it import or export suits?\\nTHE WINNERS AND LOSERS FROM TRADE\\nTo analyze the welfare effects of free trade, the Isolandian economists begin with\\nthe assumption that Isoland is a small economy compared to the rest of the worldso that its actions have negligible effect on world markets. The small-economy as-sumption has a specific implication for analyzing the steel market: If Isoland is asmall economy, then the change in Isoland’s trade policy will not affect the worldprice of steel. The Isolandians are said to be price takers in the world economy. That\\nis, they take the world price of steel as given. They can sell steel at this price andbe exporters or buy steel at this price and be importers.\\nThe small-economy assumption is not necessary to analyze the gains and\\nlosses from international trade. But the Isolandian economists know from experi-ence that this assumption greatly simplifies the analysis. They also know that thebasic lessons do not change in the more complicated case of a large economy.\\nTHE GAINS AND LOSSES OF AN EXPORTING COUNTRY\\nFigure 9-2 shows the Isolandian steel market when the domestic equilibrium pricebefore trade is below the world price. Once free trade is allowed, the domesticprice rises to equal the world price. No seller of steel would accept less than theworld price, and no buyer would pay more than the world price.\\nWith the domestic price now equal to the world price, the domestic quantity\\nsupplied differs from the domestic quantity demanded. The supply curve showsthe quantity of steel supplied by Isolandian sellers. The demand curve shows thequantity of steel demanded by Isolandian buyers. Because the domestic quantitysupplied is greater than the domestic quantity demanded, Isoland sells steel toother countries. Thus, Isoland becomes a steel exporter.\\nAlthough domestic quantity supplied and domestic quantity demanded differ,\\nthe steel market is still in equilibrium because there is now another participant inthe market: the rest of the world. One can view the horizontal line at the worldprice as representing the demand for steel from the rest of the world. This demandcurve is perfectly elastic because Isoland, as a small economy, can sell as muchsteel as it wants at the world price.CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 183\\nNow consider the gains and losses from opening up trade. Clearly, not every-\\none benefits. Trade forces the domestic price to rise to the world price. Domesticproducers of steel are better off because they can now sell steel at a higher price,but domestic consumers of steel are worse off because they have to buy steel at ahigher price.\\nTo measure these gains and losses, we look at the changes in consumer and\\nproducer surplus, which are shown in Figure 9-3 and summarized in Table 9-1. Be-fore trade is allowed, the price of steel adjusts to balance domestic supply and do-mestic demand. Consumer surplus, the area between the demand curve and thebefore-trade price, is area A /H11001B. Producer surplus, the area between the supply\\ncurve and the before-trade price, is area C. Total surplus before trade, the sum ofconsumer and producer surplus, is area A /H11001B /H11001C.\\nAfter trade is allowed, the domestic price rises to the world price. Consumer\\nsurplus is area A (the area between the demand curve and the world price). Pro-ducer surplus is area B /H11001C /H11001D (the area between the supply curve and the world\\nprice). Thus, total surplus with trade is area A /H11001B /H11001C /H11001D.\\nThese welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an\\nexporting country. Sellers benefit because producer surplus increases by the areaB/H11001D. Buyers are worse off because consumer surplus decreases by the area B. Be-\\ncause the gains of sellers exceed the losses of buyers by the area D, total surplus inIsoland increases.\\nThis analysis of an exporting country yields two conclusions:\\nNWhen a country allows trade and becomes an exporter of a good, domestic\\nproducers of the good are better off, and domestic consumers of the good areworse off.Price\\nof Steel\\nPrice\\nbefore tradePrice\\nafter trade\\n0 Quantity\\nof SteelDomestic\\nquantity\\ndemandedDomestic\\nquantity\\nsuppliedDomestic\\nsupply\\nWorld\\nprice\\nDomestic\\ndemandExportsFigure 9-2\\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE IN AN\\nEXPORTING COUNTRY .

Onceagain, after free trade is allowed, the domestic price must equal the world price. AsFigure 9-4 shows, the domestic quantity supplied is less than the domestic quan-tity demanded. The difference between the domestic quantity demanded and thedomestic quantity supplied is bought from other countries, and Isoland becomes asteel importer.\\nIn this case, the horizontal line at the world price represents the supply of the\\nrest of the world. This supply curve is perfectly elastic because Isoland is a smalleconomy and, therefore, can buy as much steel as it wants at the world price.CBDAPrice\\nof Steel\\nPrice\\nbefore tradePrice\\nafter trade\\n0 Quantity\\nof SteelDomestic\\nsupply\\nWorld\\nprice\\nDomestic\\ndemandExportsFigure 9-3\\nHOWFREETRADE AFFECTS\\nWELFARE IN AN EXPORTING\\nCOUNTRY .

Once again, not everyone ben-\\nefits. When trade forces the domestic price to fall, domestic consumers are betteroff (they can now buy steel at a lower price), and domestic producers are worse off(they now have to sell steel at a lower price). Changes in consumer and producersurplus measure the size of the gains and losses, as shown in Figure 9-5 and Ta-ble 9-2. Before trade, consumer surplus is area A, producer surplus is area B /H11001C,\\nand total surplus is area A /H11001B /H11001C. After trade is allowed, consumer surplus\\nis area A /H11001B /H11001D, producer surplus is area C, and total surplus is area\\nA/H11001B/H11001C/H11001D.\\nThese welfare calculations show who wins and who loses from trade in an im-\\nporting country.

In either case, however, the gains of the winners exceed the losses of thelosers, so the winners could compensate the losers and still be better off. In thissense, trade canmake everyone better off. But willtrade make everyone better off?\\nProbably not. In practice, compensation for the losers from international trade israre. Without such compensation, opening up to international trade is a policy thatexpands the size of the economic pie, while perhaps leaving some participants inthe economy with a smaller slice.\\nTHE EFFECTS OF A TARIFF\\nThe Isolandian economists next consider the effects of a tariff —a tax on imported\\ngoods.

The tariff matters only if Isoland becomes\\na steel importer. Concentrating their attention on this case, the economists com-pare welfare with and without the tariff.\\nFigure 9-6 shows the Isolandian market for steel. Under free trade, the domes-\\ntic price equals the world price. A tariff raises the price of imported steel above theworld price by the amount of the tariff. Domestic suppliers of steel, who competewith suppliers of imported steel, can now sell their steel for the world price plusthe amount of the tariff. Thus, the price of steel—both imported and domestic—rises by the amount of the tariff and is, therefore, closer to the price that wouldprevail without trade.\\nThe change in price affects the behavior of domestic buyers and sellers. Be-\\ncause the tariff raises the price of steel, it reduces the domestic quantity demandedfrom Q\\n1Dto Q2Dand raises the domestic quantity supplied from Q1Sto Q2S. Thus, the\\ntariff reduces the quantity of imports and moves the domestic market closer to its equilib-rium without trade.\\nNow consider the gains and losses from the tariff. Because the tariff raises the\\ndomestic price, domestic sellers are better off, and domestic buyers are worse off.In addition, the government raises revenue. To measure these gains and losses, welook at the changes in consumer surplus, producer surplus, and government rev-enue. These changes are summarized in Table 9-3.\\nBefore the tariff, the domestic price equals the world price.

Letters refer to the regions\\nmarked in Figure 9-6.The area D /H11001F shows the fall in total surplus and represents the deadweight loss of the tariff.CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 189\\nIt is not surprising that a tariff causes a deadweight loss, because a tariff is a\\ntype of tax. Like any tax on the sale of a good, it distorts incentives and pushes theallocation of scarce resources away from the optimum. In this case, we can identifytwo effects. First, the tariff on steel raises the price of steel that domestic producerscan charge above the world price and, as a result, encourages them to increase pro-duction of steel (from Q\\n1Sto Q2S). Second, the tariff raises the price that domestic\\nsteel buyers have to pay and, therefore, encourages them to reduce consumptionof steel (from Q\\n1Dto Q2D). Area D represents the deadweight loss from the overpro-\\nduction of steel, and area F represents the deadweight loss from the undercon-sumption. The total deadweight loss of the tariff is the sum of these two triangles.\\nTHE EFFECTS OF AN IMPORT QUOTA\\nThe Isolandian economists next consider the effects of an import quota —a limit on\\nthe quantity of imports. In particular, imagine that the Isolandian government dis-tributes a limited number of import licenses. Each license gives the license holderthe right to import 1 ton of steel into Isoland from abroad. The Isolandian econo-mists want to compare welfare under a policy of free trade and welfare with theaddition of this import quota.\\nFigure 9-7 shows how an import quota affects the Isolandian market for steel.\\nBecause the import quota prevents Isolandians from buying as much steel as theywant from abroad, the supply of steel is no longer perfectly elastic at the worldprice. Instead, as long as the price of steel in Isoland is above the world price, thelicense holders import as much as they are permitted, and the total supply of steelin Isoland equals the domestic supply plus the quota amount. That is, the supplycurve above the world price is shifted to the right by exactly the amount of thequota. (The supply curve below the world price does not shift because, in this case,importing is not profitable for the license holders.)\\nThe price of steel in Isoland adjusts to balance supply (domestic plus im-\\nported) and demand. As the figure shows, the quota causes the price of steel to riseabove the world price. The domestic quantity demanded falls from Q\\n1Dto Q2D, and\\nthe domestic quantity supplied rises from Q1Sto Q2S. Not surprisingly, the import\\nquota reduces steel imports.\\nNow consider the gains and losses from the quota. Because the quota raises\\nthe domestic price above the world price, domestic sellers are better off, and do-mestic buyers are worse off. In addition, the license holders are better off becausethey make a profit from buying at the world price and selling at the higherdomestic price. To measure these gains and losses, we look at the changes inconsumer surplus, producer surplus, and license-holder surplus, as shown inTable 9-4.\\nBefore the government imposes the quota, the domestic price equals the world\\nprice. Consumer surplus, the area between the demand curve and the world price,is area A /H11001B /H11001C /H11001D /H11001E' /H11001E''/H11001F. Producer surplus, the area between the sup-\\nply curve and the world price, is area G. The surplus of license holders equals zerobecause there are no licenses. Total surplus, the sum of consumer, producer, andlicense-holder surplus, is area A /H11001B /H11001C /H11001D /H11001E' /H11001E'' /H11001F /H11001G.\\nAfter the government imposes the import quota and issues the licenses, the\\ndomestic price exceeds the world price. Domestic consumers get surplus equal toarea A/H11001B, and domestic producers get surplus equal to area C /H11001G. The license\\nholders make a profit on each unit imported equal to the difference between theimport quota\\na limit on the quantity of a good thatcan be produced abroad and solddomestically190 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nIsolandian price of steel and the world price. Their surplus equals this price dif-\\nferential times the quantity of imports. Thus, it equals the area of the rectangleE'/H11001E''. Total surplus with the quota is the area A /H11001B /H11001C /H11001E' /H11001E'' /H11001G.\\nTo see how total welfare changes with the imposition of the quota, we add the\\nchange in consumer surplus (which is negative), the change in producer surplus(positive), and the change in license-holder surplus (positive). We find that totalsurplus in the market decreases by the area D /H11001F.

The table compares economic welfare\\nwhen trade is unrestricted and when trade is restricted with an import quota. Letters refer\\nto the regions marked in Figure 9-7.The area D /H11001F shows the fall in total surplus and represents the deadweight loss of the quota.CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 191\\nThis analysis should seem somewhat familiar. Indeed, if you compare the\\nanalysis of import quotas in Figure 9-7 with the analysis of tariffs in Figure 9-6, youwill see that they are essentially identical. Both tariffs and import quotas raise the do-\\nmestic price of the good, reduce the welfare of domestic consumers, increase the welfare ofdomestic producers, and cause deadweight losses. There is only one difference between\\nthese two types of trade restriction: A tariff raises revenue for the government(area E in Figure 9-6), whereas an import quota creates surplus for license holders(area E' /H11001E'' in Figure 9-7).\\nTariffs and import quotas can be made to look even more similar. Suppose that\\nthe government tries to capture the license-holder surplus for itself by charging afee for the licenses. A license to sell 1 ton of steel is worth exactly the difference be-tween the Isolandian price of steel and the world price, and the government canset the license fee as high as this price differential. If the government does this, thelicense fee for imports works exactly like a tariff: Consumer surplus, producer sur-plus, and government revenue are exactly the same under the two policies.\\nIn practice, however, countries that restrict trade with import quotas rarely do\\nso by selling the import licenses. For example, the U.S. government has at timespressured Japan to “voluntarily” limit the sale of Japanese cars in the UnitedStates. In this case, the Japanese government allocates the import licenses to Japan-ese firms, and the surplus from these licenses (area E' /H11001E'') accrues to those firms.\\nThis kind of import quota is, from the standpoint of U.S. welfare, strictly worsethan a U.S. tariff on imported cars. Both a tariff and an import quota raise prices,restrict trade, and cause deadweight losses, but at least the tariff produces revenuefor the U.S. government rather than for Japanese auto companies.\\nAlthough in our analysis so far import quotas and tariffs appear to cause sim-\\nilar deadweight losses, a quota can potentially cause an even larger deadweightloss, depending on the mechanism used to allocate the import licenses. Supposethat when Isoland imposes a quota, everyone understands that the licenses will goto those who spend the most resources lobbying the Isolandian government. Inthis case, there is an implicit license fee—the cost of lobbying. The revenues fromthis fee, however, rather than being collected by the government, are spent on lob-bying expenses. The deadweight losses from this type of quota include not onlythe losses from overproduction (area D) and underconsumption (area F) but alsowhatever part of the license-holder surplus (area E' /H11001E'') is wasted on the cost of\\nlobbying.\\nTHE LESSONS FOR TRADE POLICY\\nThe team of Isolandian economists can now write to the new president:\\nDear Madam President,\\nYou asked us three questions about opening up trade. After much\\nhard work, we have the answers.\\nQuestion: If the government allowed Isolandians to import and export\\nsteel, what would happen to the price of steel and the quantity of steelsold in the domestic steel market?\\nAnswer: Once trade is allowed, the Isolandian price of steel would be\\ndriven to equal the price prevailing around the world.192 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nIf the world price is now higher than the Isolandian price, our price\\nwould rise. The higher price would reduce the amount of steel Isolandiansconsume and raise the amount of steel that Isolandians produce. Isolandwould, therefore, become a steel exporter. This occurs because, in this case,Isoland would have a comparative advantage in producing steel.\\nConversely, if the world price is now lower than the Isolandian price,\\nour price would fall. The lower price would raise the amount of steel thatIsolandians consume and lower the amount of steel that Isolandians pro-duce. Isoland would, therefore, become a steel importer. This occurs be-cause, in this case, other countries would have a comparative advantagein producing steel.\\nQuestion: Who would gain from free trade in steel and who would\\nlose, and would the gains exceed the losses?\\nAnswer: The answer depends on whether the price rises or falls when\\ntrade is allowed. If the price rises, producers of steel gain, and consumersof steel lose. If the price falls, consumers gain, and producers lose. In bothcases, the gains are larger than the losses. Thus, free trade raises the totalwelfare of Isolandians.\\nQuestion: Should a tariff or an import quota be part of the new trade\\npolicy?\\nAnswer: A tariff, like most taxes, has deadweight losses: The revenue\\nraised would be smaller than the losses to the buyers and sellers. In thiscase, the deadweight losses occur because the tariff would move the econ-omy closer to our current no-trade equilibrium. An import quota worksmuch like a tariff and would cause similar deadweight losses. The bestpolicy, from the standpoint of economic efficiency, would be to allow tradewithout a tariff or an import quota.\\nWe hope you find these answers helpful as you decide on your new\\npolicy.\\nYour faithful servants,\\nIsolandian economics team\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the supply and demand curve for wool suits in the \\ncountry of Autarka.

In your diagram, what is the change in consumer surplus, the \\nchange in producer surplus, and the change in total surplus? How would a \\ntariff on suit imports alter these effects?\\nTHE ARGUMENTS FOR RESTRICTING TRADE\\nThe letter from the economics team persuades the new president of Isoland to con-\\nsider opening up trade in steel. She notes that the domestic price is now high com-pared to the world price. Free trade would, therefore, cause the price of steel to falland hurt domestic steel producers. Before implementing the new policy, she asksIsolandian steel companies to comment on the economists’ advice.CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 193\\nNot surprisingly, the steel companies are opposed to free trade in steel. They\\nbelieve that the government should protect the domestic steel industry from for-eign competition. Let’s consider some of the arguments they might give to supporttheir position and how the economics team would respond.\\nTHE JOBS ARGUMENT\\nOpponents of free trade often argue that trade with other countries destroysdomestic jobs. In our example, free trade in steel would cause the price of steel tofall, reducing the quantity of steel produced in Isoland and thus reducing employ-ment in the Isolandian steel industry. Some Isolandian steelworkers would losetheir jobs.\\nYet free trade creates jobs at the same time that it destroys them. When Iso-\\nlandians buy steel from other countries, those countries obtain the resources tobuy other goods from Isoland. Isolandian workers would move from the steel in-dustry to those industries in which Isoland has a comparative advantage. Al-though the transition may impose hardship on some workers in the short run, itallows Isolandians as a whole to enjoy a higher standard of living.\\nOpponents of trade are often skeptical that trade creates jobs. They might re-\\nspond that everything can be produced more cheaply abroad. Under free trade,\\nthey might argue, Isolandians could not be profitably employed in any industry.\\nOur conclusions so far have\\nbeen based on the standardanalysis of international trade.As we have seen, there are win-ners and losers when a nationopens itself up to trade, but thegains to the winners exceedthe losses of the losers. Yetthe case for free trade canbe made even stronger. Thereare several other economicbenefits of trade beyond thoseemphasized in the standardanalysis.\\nHere, in a nutshell, are some of these other benefits:\\nNIncreased variety of goods: Goods produced in different\\ncountries are not exactly the same. German beer, for in-stance, is not the same as American beer. Free tradegives consumers in all countries greater variety fromwhich to choose.\\nNLower costs through economies of scale: Some goods\\ncan be produced at low cost only if they are produced inlarge quantities—a phenomenon called economies of\\nscale. A firm in a small country cannot take full advan-tage of economies of scale if it can sell only in a small\\ndomestic market. Free trade gives firms access tolarger world markets and allows them to realizeeconomies of scale more fully.\\nNIncreased competition: A company shielded from for-\\neign competitors is more likely to have market power,which in turn gives it the ability to raise prices abovecompetitive levels. This is a type of market failure.Opening up trade fosters competition and gives the in-visible hand a better chance to work its magic.\\nNEnhanced flow of ideas: The transfer of technological\\nadvances around the world is often thought to be linkedto international trade in the goods that embody thoseadvances. The best way for a poor, agricultural nation tolearn about the computer revolution, for instance, is tobuy some computers from abroad, rather than trying tomake them domestically.\\nThus, free international trade increases variety for con-\\nsumers, allows firms to take advantage of economies ofscale, makes markets more competitive, and facilitates thespread of technology. If the Isolandian economists thoughtthese effects were important, their advice to their presidentwould be even more forceful.\\nFYI\\nOther Benefits\\nof International\\nTrade\\n“You like protectionism as a\\n‘working man.’ How about as aconsumer?”194 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nAs Chapter 3 explains, however, the gains from trade are based on comparative\\nadvantage, not absolute advantage. Even if one country is better than anothercountry at producing everything, each country can still gain from trading with theother. Workers in each country will eventually find jobs in the industry in whichthat country has a comparative advantage.\\nTHE NATIONAL-SECURITY ARGUMENT\\nWhen an industry is threatened with competition from other countries, opponentsof free trade often argue that the industry is vital for national security. In our ex-ample, Isolandian steel companies might point out that steel is used to make gunsand tanks. Free trade would allow Isoland to become dependent on foreign coun-tries to supply steel. If a war later broke out, Isoland might be unable to produceenough steel and weapons to defend itself.\\nEconomists acknowledge that protecting key industries may be appropriate\\nwhen there are legitimate concerns over national security. Yet they fear that this ar-gument may be used too quickly by producers eager to gain at consumers’ ex-pense. The U.S. watchmaking industry, for instance, long argued that it was vitalfor national security, claiming that its skilled workers would be necessary inwartime. Certainly, it is tempting for those in an industry to exaggerate their rolein national defense in order to obtain protection from foreign competition.\\nTHE INFANT-INDUSTRY ARGUMENT\\nNew industries sometimes argue for temporary trade restrictions to help them getstarted. After a period of protection, the argument goes, these industries will ma-ture and be able to compete with foreign competitors. Similarly, older industriessometimes argue that they need temporary protection to help them adjust to newconditions. For example, General Motors Chairman Roger Smith once argued fortemporary protection “to give U.S. automakers turnaround time to get the domes-tic industry back on its feet.”\\nEconomists are often skeptical about such claims. The primary reason is that\\nthe infant-industry argument is difficult to implement in practice. To apply pro-tection successfully, the government would need to decide which industries willeventually be profitable and decide whether the benefits of establishing these in-dustries exceed the costs to consumers of protection. Yet “picking winners” is ex-traordinarily difficult. It is made even more difficult by the political process, whichoften awards protection to those industries that are politically powerful. And oncea powerful industry is protected from foreign competition, the “temporary” policyis hard to remove.\\nIn addition, many economists are skeptical about the infant-industry argu-\\nment even in principle. Suppose, for instance, that the Isolandian steel industry isyoung and unable to compete profitably against foreign rivals. Yet there is reasonto believe that the industry can be profitable in the long run. In this case, the own-ers of the firms should be willing to incur temporary losses in order to obtain theeventual profits. Protection is not necessary for an industry to grow. Firms in var-ious industries—such as many Internet firms today—incur temporary losses in thehope of growing and becoming profitable in the future. And many of them suc-ceed, even without protection from foreign competition.CHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 195\\nCASE STUDY TRADE AGREEMENTS\\nA country can take one of two approaches to achieving free trade. It can take a\\nunilateral approach and remove its trade restrictions on its own. This is the ap-\\nproach that Great Britain took in the nineteenth century and that Chile andSouth Korea have taken in recent years. Alternatively, a country can take a mul-\\ntilateral approach and reduce its trade restrictions while other countries do theTHE UNFAIR-COMPETITION ARGUMENT\\nA common argument is that free trade is desirable only if all countries play by the\\nsame rules. If firms in different countries are subject to different laws and regu-lations, then it is unfair (the argument goes) to expect the firms to compete in theinternational marketplace. For instance, suppose that the government of Neigh-borland subsidizes its steel industry by giving steel companies large tax breaks.The Isolandian steel industry might argue that it should be protected from this for-eign competition because Neighborland is not competing fairly.\\nWould it, in fact, hurt Isoland to buy steel from another country at a sub-\\nsidized price? Certainly, Isolandian steel producers would suffer, but Isolandiansteel consumers would benefit from the low price. Moreover, the case for free tradeis no different: The gains of the consumers from buying at the low price would ex-ceed the losses of the producers. Neighborland’s subsidy to its steel industry maybe a bad policy, but it is the taxpayers of Neighborland who bear the burden.Isoland can benefit from the opportunity to buy steel at a subsidized price.\\nTHE PROTECTION-AS-A-BARGAINING-CHIP ARGUMENT\\nAnother argument for trade restrictions concerns the strategy of bargaining. Manypolicymakers claim to support free trade but, at the same time, argue that trade re-strictions can be useful when we bargain with our trading partners. They claimthat the threat of a trade restriction can help remove a trade restriction already im-posed by a foreign government. For example, Isoland might threaten to impose atariff on steel unless Neighborland removes its tariff on wheat. If Neighborland re-sponds to this threat by removing its tariff, the result can be freer trade.\\nThe problem with this bargaining strategy is that the threat may not work. If it\\ndoesn’t work, the country has a difficult choice. It can carry out its threat and im-plement the trade restriction, which would reduce its own economic welfare. Or itcan back down from its threat, which would cause it to lose prestige in interna-tional affairs. Faced with this choice, the country would probably wish that it hadnever made the threat in the first place.\\nAn example of this occurred in 1999, when the U.S. government accused\\nEuropeans of restricting the import of U.S. bananas. After a long and bitter disputewith governments that are normally U.S. allies, the United States placed 100 per-cent tariffs on a range of European products from cheese to cashmere. In the end,not only were Europeans denied the benefits of American bananas, but Americanswere denied the benefits of European cheese. Sometimes, when a government en-gages in a game of brinkmanship, as the United States did in this case, everyonegoes over the brink together.196 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nsame. In other words, it can bargain with its trading partners in an attempt to\\nreduce trade restrictions around the world.\\nOne important example of the multilateral approach is the North American\\nFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which in 1993 lowered trade barriers amongthe United States, Mexico, and Canada.

The UnitedStates helped to found GATT after World War II in response to the high tariffsimposed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Many economists believethat the high tariffs contributed to the economic hardship during that period.GATT has successfully reduced the average tariff among member countriesfrom about 40 percent after World War II to about 5 percent today. The rules es-tablished under GATT are now enforced by an international institution calledthe World Trade Organization (WTO).\\nWhat are the pros and cons of the multilateral approach to free trade? One\\nadvantage is that the multilateral approach has the potential to result in freertrade than a unilateral approach because it can reduce trade restrictions abroadas well as at home. If international negotiations fail, however, the result couldbe more restricted trade than under a unilateral approach.\\nIn addition, the multilateral approach may have a political advantage. In\\nmost markets, producers are fewer and better organized than consumers—andthus wield greater political influence. Reducing the Isolandian tariff on steel, forexample, may be politically difficult if considered by itself. The steel companieswould oppose free trade, and the users of steel who would benefit are so nu-merous that organizing their support would be difficult. Yet suppose thatNeighborland promises to reduce its tariff on wheat at the same time thatIsoland reduces its tariff on steel. In this case, the Isolandian wheat farmers,who are also politically powerful, would back the agreement. Thus, the multi-lateral approach to free trade can sometimes win political support when a uni-lateral reduction cannot.\\nQUICK QUIZ: The textile industry of Autarka advocates a ban on the \\nimport of wool suits. Describe five arguments its lobbyists might make. Give a \\nresponse to each of these arguments.\\nCONCLUSION\\nEconomists and the general public often disagree about free trade. In 1993, for ex-\\nample, the United States faced the question of whether to ratify the North Ameri-can Free Trade Agreement, which reduced trade restrictions among the UnitedStates, Canada, and Mexico. Opinion polls showed the general public in theUnited States about evenly split on the issue, and the agreement passed in Con-gress by only a narrow margin. Opponents viewed free trade as a threat to jobsecurity and the American standard of living. By contrast, economists overwhelm-ingly supported the agreement. They viewed free trade as a way of allocating pro-duction efficiently and raising living standards in all three countries.\\nEconomists view the United States as an ongoing experiment that confirms the\\nvirtues of free trade. Throughout its history, the United States has allowed unre-stricted trade among the states, and the country as a whole has benefited from thespecialization that trade allows. Florida grows oranges, Texas pumps oil, Califor-nia makes wine, and so on. Americans would not enjoy the high standard of living198 PART THREE SUPPLY AND DEMAND II: MARKETS AND WELFARE\\nthey do today if people could consume only those goods and services produced\\nin their own states. The world could similarly benefit from free trade amongcountries.\\nTo better understand economists’ view of trade, let’s continue our parable.\\nSuppose that the country of Isoland ignores the advice of its economics team anddecides not to allow free trade in steel. The country remains in the equilibriumwithout international trade.\\nThen, one day, some Isolandian inventor discovers a new way to make steel at\\nvery low cost. The process is quite mysterious, however, and the inventor insistson keeping it a secret. What is odd is that the inventor doesn’t need any workersor iron ore to make steel. The only input he requires is wheat.ECONOMIST JAGDISH BHAGWATI ARGUES\\nthat the United States should lower its\\ntrade barriers unilaterally.\\nFree Trade without Treaties\\nBYJAGDISH BHAGWATI\\nPresident Clinton and 17 other Asian-Pacific leaders are meeting today inVancouver. Rather than the convivialphoto-op they’d planned, however, theymust contend with worrisome tradenews. A spate of Asian currency devalu-ations has raised the specter of renewedprotectionism around the world. SouthAmerica’s Mercosur trade bloc, led byBrazil, just raised its tariffs some 30 per-cent. And Congress turned its back onthe president and refused to approvefast-track authority for him to negotiatefurther free-trade accords. [\\nAuthor’snote: Fast-track authority would allow\\nthe president to negotiate trade dealsthat Congress would consider withoutthe ability to attach amendments.]\\nIn light of all this dismaying news,\\nwhat are the prospects for free trade? Isthe future bleak, or will the postwar trendof dramatic liberalization continue to ac-celerate despite these setbacks?\\nThe immediate prospects for more\\nU.S.-led multilateral trade accords do in-deed look grim after the defeat of fast-track. But that doesn’t mean that freetrade itself is on the ropes. A large por-tion of the world’s trade liberalization inthe last quarter-century has been \\nunilat-\\neral. Those countries that lower trade\\nbarriers of their own accord not onlyprofit themselves, but also often inducethe laggards to match their example. Themost potent force for the worldwidefreeing of trade, then, is unilateral U.S.action. If the United States continues todo away with tariffs and trade barriers,other countries will follow suit—fast-track or no fast-track.\\nTo be sure, the General Agreement\\non Tariffs and Trade, the World Trade Or-ganization, and other multilateral tariff re-ductions have greatly contributed toglobal wealth. The WTO has become theinternational institution for setting the“rules” on public and private practicesthat affect competition among trading\\nnations. Much still needs to be done inthat mode, particularly on agriculture tar-iffs, which remain too high around theworld. A future U.S. president, if not Mr.Clinton, will certainly need fast-track au-thority if another multilateral effort, suchas the “millennium round” called for bySir Leon Brittan of the European Union,is to pursue these goals.\\nBut the good news is that even if\\norganized labor, radical environmental-ists, and others who fear the globaleconomy continue to impede fast-trackduring Congress’s next session, theycannot stop the historic freeing of tradethat has been occurring unilaterallyworldwide.\\nFrom the 1970s through the 1990s,\\nLatin America witnessed dramatic lower-ing of trade barriers unilaterally by Chile,Bolivia, and Paraguay; and the entirecontinent has been moving steadily to-ward further trade liberalization. Merco-sur’s recent actions are a setback, butonly a small one—so far.\\nLatin America’s record has been\\nbettered by unilateral liberalizers in Asiaand the Pacific. New Zealand began dis-mantling its substantial trade protectionapparatus in 1985. That effort was drivenby the reformist views of then-PrimeMinister David Lange, who declared, “In\\nIN THE NEWS\\nThe Case for\\nUnilateral Disarmament\\nin the Trade WarsCHAPTER 9 APPLICATION: INTERNATIONAL TRADE 199\\nThe inventor is hailed as a genius. Because steel is used in so many products,\\nthe invention lowers the cost of many goods and allows all Isolandians to enjoy ahigher standard of living. Workers who had previously produced steel do sufferwhen their factories close, but eventually they find work in other industries. Somebecome farmers and grow the wheat that the inventor turns into steel. Others en-ter new industries that emerge as a result of higher Isolandian living standards.Everyone understands that the displacement of these workers is an inevitable partof progress.\\nAfter several years, a newspaper reporter decides to investigate this mysteri-\\nous new steel process. She sneaks into the inventor’s factory and learns that the in-ventor is a fraud. The inventor has not been making steel at all. Instead, he hasthe course of about three years we\\nchanged from being a country run like aPolish shipyard into one that could be in-ternationally competitive.”\\nSince the 1980s, Hong Kong’s and\\nSingapore’s enormous successes asfree traders have served as potent ex-amples of unilateral market opening, en-couraging Indonesia, the Philippines,Thailand, South Korea, and Malaysia tofollow suit. By 1991 even India, whichhas been astonishingly autarkic for morethan four decades, had finally learned thevirtue of free trade and had embarked ona massive lowering of its tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\\nIn Central and Eastern Europe, the\\ncollapse of communism led to a whole-sale, unilateral, and nondiscriminatory re-moval of trade barriers as well. TheFrench economist Patrick Messerlin hasshown how this happened in threewaves: Czechoslovakia, Poland, andHungary liberalized right after the fall ofthe Berlin Wall; next came Bulgaria, Ro-mania, and Slovenia; and finally, theBaltic countries began unilateral openingin 1991. . . .\\nU.S. leadership is crucial to main-\\ntaining the trend toward free trade. Suchultramodern industries as telecommuni-cations and financial services gainedtheir momentum largely from unilateralopenness and deregulation in the United\\nStates. This in turn led to a softening ofprotectionist attitudes in the EuropeanUnion and Japan.\\nThese developed economies are\\nnow moving steadily in the direction ofopenness and competition—not be-cause any officials in Washingtonthreaten them with retribution, but be-cause they’ve seen how U.S. companiesbecome more competitive once regula-tion and other trade barriers have fallen.A Brussels bureaucrat can argue with aWashington bureaucrat, but he cannotargue with the markets. Faced with theprospect of being elbowed out of worldmarkets by American firms, Japan andEurope have no option but to follow theU.S. example, belatedly but surely, inopening their own markets.\\nThe biggest threat to free trade is\\nnot the loss of fast-track per se, but thesignal it sends that Americans may notbe interested in lowering their trade bar-riers any further. To counteract this atti-tude, President Clinton needs to mountthe bully pulpit and explain the case forfree trade—a case that Adam Smith firstmade more than 200 years ago, but thatcontinues to come under attack.\\nThe president, free from the bur-\\ndens of constituency interests that crip-ple many in Congress, could argue,credibly and with much evidence, that\\nfree trade is in the interest of the wholeworld, but that, because the U.S. econ-omy is the most competitive anywhere,we have the most to gain. The presidentcould also point to plenty of evidencethat debunks the claims of protection-ists. The unions may argue that tradewith poor countries depresses our work-ers’ wages, for example, but in fact thebest evidence shows that such trade has\\nhelped workers by moderating the fall in\\ntheir wages from technological changes.\\nAssuming that the president can\\nmake the case for free trade at home,the prospects for free trade worldwideremain bright. The United States doesn’tneed to sign treaties to open markets or,heaven forbid, issue counterproductivethreats to close our own markets if oth-ers are less open than we are. We sim-ply need to offer an example ofopenness and deregulation to the rest ofthe world. Other countries will see oursuccess, and seek to emulate it.\\nSOURCE :The Wall Street Journal, November 24,\\n1997, p.

The only\\nthing that the inventor had discovered was the gains from international trade.\\nWhen the truth is revealed, the government shuts down the inventor’s opera-\\ntion. The price of steel rises, and workers return to jobs in steel factories. Livingstandards in Isoland fall back to their former levels. The inventor is jailed and heldup to public ridicule. After all, he was no inventor. He was just an economist.\\nN The effects of free trade can be determined by\\ncomparing the domestic price without trade to theworld price. A low domestic price indicates that thecountry has a comparative advantage in producing thegood and that the country will become an exporter. Ahigh domestic price indicates that the rest of the worldhas a comparative advantage in producing the good andthat the country will become an importer.\\nN When a country allows trade and becomes an exporter\\nof a good, producers of the good are better off, andconsumers of the good are worse off. When a countryallows trade and becomes an importer of a good,consumers are better off, and producers are worse off. Inboth cases, the gains from trade exceed the losses.\\nN A tariff—a tax on imports—moves a market closer to the\\nequilibrium that would exist without trade and,therefore, reduces the gains from trade. Although\\ndomestic producers are better off and the governmentraises revenue, the losses to consumers exceed thesegains.\\nN An import quota has effects that are similar to those of a\\ntariff. Under a quota, however, the holders of the importlicenses receive the revenue that the government wouldcollect with a tariff.\\nN There are various arguments for restricting trade:\\nprotecting jobs, defending national security, helpinginfant industries, preventing unfair competition, andresponding to foreign trade restrictions.

In some years,firms throughout the economy are expanding their production of goods and ser-vices, employment is rising, and jobs are easy to find. In other years, firms are cut-ting back on production, employment is declining, and finding a good job takes along time. Not surprisingly, any college graduate would rather enter the laborforce in a year of economic expansion than in a year of economic contraction.\\nBecause the condition of the overall economy profoundly affects all of us,\\nchanges in economic conditions are widely reported by the media. Indeed, it is hardto pick up a newspaper without seeing some newly reported statistic about theeconomy. The statistic might measure the total income of everyone in the economy(GDP), the rate at which average prices are rising (inflation), the percentage of thelabor force that is out of work (unemployment), total spending at stores (retailMEASURING A NATION’S\\nINCOME\\n205206 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nsales), or the imbalance of trade between the United States and the rest of the world\\n(the trade deficit). All these statistics are macroeconomic. Rather than telling us about\\na particular household or firm, they tell us something about the entire economy.\\nAs you may recall from Chapter 2, economics is divided into two branches:\\nmicroeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is the study of how indi-\\nvidual households and firms make decisions and how they interact with oneanother in markets. Macroeconomics is the study of the economy as a whole. The\\ngoal of macroeconomics is to explain the economic changes that affect manyhouseholds, firms, and markets at once. Macroeconomists address diverse ques-tions: Why is average income high in some countries while it is low in others? Whydo prices rise rapidly in some periods of time while they are more stable in otherperiods? Why do production and employment expand in some years and contractin others? What, if anything, can the government do to promote rapid growth inincomes, low inflation, and stable employment? These questions are all macroeco-nomic in nature because they concern the workings of the entire economy.\\nBecause the economy as a whole is just a collection of many households and\\nmany firms interacting in many markets, microeconomics and macroeconomicsare closely linked. The basic tools of supply and demand, for instance, are as cen-tral to macroeconomic analysis as they are to microeconomic analysis. Yet study-ing the economy in its entirety raises some new and intriguing challenges.\\nIn this chapter and the next one, we discuss some of the data that economists\\nand policymakers use to monitor the performance of the overall economy. Thesedata reflect the economic changes that macroeconomists try to explain. This chap-ter considers gross domestic product, or simply GDP , which measures the total\\nincome of a nation. GDP is the most closely watched economic statistic because itis thought to be the best single measure of a society’s economic well-being.\\nTHE ECONOMY’S INCOME AND EXPENDITURE\\nIf you were to judge how a person is doing economically, you might first look athis or her income. A person with a high income can more easily afford life’s neces-sities and luxuries. It is no surprise that people with higher incomes enjoy higherstandards of living—better housing, better health care, fancier cars, more opulentvacations, and so on.\\nThe same logic applies to a nation’s overall economy. When judging whether the\\neconomy is doing well or poorly, it is natural to look at the total income that every-one in the economy is earning. That is the task of gross domestic product (GDP).\\nGDP measures two things at once: the total income of everyone in the econo-\\nmy and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. Thereason that GDP can perform the trick of measuring both total income and totalexpenditure is that these two things are really the same. For an economy as a whole,\\nincome must equal expenditure.\\nWhy is this true? The reason that an economy’s income is the same as its expen-\\nditure is simply that every transaction has two parties: a buyer and a seller. Everydollar of spending by some buyer is a dollar of income for some seller. Suppose, forinstance, that Karen pays Doug $100 to mow her lawn. In this case, Doug is a sellerof a service, and Karen is a buyer. Doug earns $100, and Karen spends $100. Thus,microeconomics\\nthe study of how households andfirms make decisions and how theyinteract in markets\\nmacroeconomics\\nthe study of economy-widephenomena, including inflation,unemployment, and economicgrowthCHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 207\\nthe transaction contributes equally to the economy’s income and to its expenditure.\\nGDP , whether measured as total income or total expenditure, rises by $100.\\nAnother way to see the equality of income and expenditure is with the circular-\\nflow diagram in Figure 10-1. (You may recall this circular-flow diagram fromChapter 2.) This diagram describes all the transactions between households andfirms in a simple economy. In this economy, households buy goods and servicesfrom firms; these expenditures flow through the markets for goods and services.The firms in turn use the money they receive from sales to pay workers’ wages,landowners’ rent, and firm owners’ profit; this income flows through the marketsfor the factors of production. In this economy, money continuously flows fromhouseholds to firms and then back to households.\\nWe can compute GDP for this economy in one of two ways: by adding up the\\ntotal expenditure by households or by adding up the total income (wages, rent,and profit) paid by firms. Because all expenditure in the economy ends up assomeone’s income, GDP is the same regardless of how we compute it.\\nThe actual economy is, of course, more complicated than the one illustrated in\\nFigure 10-1. In particular, households do not spend all of their income. Householdspay some of their income to the government in taxes, and they save and investsome of their income for use in the future. In addition, households do not buy allSpending\\n(= GDP)\\nGoods and\\nservicesboughtRevenue\\n(= GDP)\\nGoods\\nand servicessold\\nLabor, land,\\nand capital\\nIncome (= GDP)\\n/H11005Flow of goods\\nand services\\n/H11005Flow of dollarsInputs for\\nproduction\\nWages, rent,\\nand profit(= GDP)FIRMS HOUSEHOLDS\\nMARKETS FOR\\nFACTORS OF\\nPRODUCTIONMARKETS FOR\\nGOODS AND\\nSERVICESFigure 10-1\\nTHECIRCULAR -FLOW DIAGRAM .\\nHouseholds buy goods andservices from firms, and firms usetheir revenue from sales to paywages to workers, rent tolandowners, and profit to firmowners. GDP equals the totalamount spent by households inthe market for goods andservices. It also equals the totalwages, rent, and profit paid byfirms in the markets for thefactors of production.208 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\ngoods and services produced in the economy. Some goods and services are bought\\nby governments, and some are bought by firms that plan to use them in the futureto produce their own output. Yet, regardless of whether a household, government,or firm buys a good or service, the transaction has a buyer and seller. Thus, for theeconomy as a whole, expenditure and income are always the same.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What two things does gross domestic product measure? \\nHow can it measure two things at once?\\nTHE MEASUREMENT OF GROSS \\nDOMESTIC PRODUCT\\nNow that we have discussed the meaning of gross domestic product in general\\nterms, let’s be more precise about how this statistic is measured. Here is a defini-tion of GDP:\\nNGross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and\\nservices produced within a country in a given period of time.\\nThis definition might seem simple enough. But, in fact, many subtle issues arise\\nwhen computing an economy’s GDP . Let’s therefore consider each phrase in thisdefinition with some care.\\n“GDP IS THE MARKET VALUE . . .”\\nYou have probably heard the adage, “You can’t compare apples and oranges.” YetGDP does exactly that. GDP adds together many different kinds of products into asingle measure of the value of economic activity. To do this, it uses market prices.Because market prices measure the amount people are willing to pay for differentgoods, they reflect the value of those goods. If the price of an apple is twice the priceof an orange, then an apple contributes twice as much to GDP as does an orange.\\n“OF ALL . . .”\\nGDP tries to be comprehensive. It includes all items produced in the economy andsold legally in markets. GDP measures the market value of not just apples andoranges, but also pears and grapefruit, books and movies, haircuts and health care,and on and on.\\nGDP also includes the market value of the housing services provided by the\\neconomy’s stock of housing. For rental housing, this value is easy to calculate—therent equals both the tenant’s expenditure and the landlord’s income. Yet manypeople own the place where they live and, therefore, do not pay rent. The govern-ment includes this owner-occupied housing in GDP by estimating its rental value.That is, GDP is based on the assumption that the owner, in effect, pays rent to him-self, so the rent is included both in his expenditure and in his income.\\nThere are some products, however, that GDP excludes because measuring\\nthem is so difficult. GDP excludes items produced and sold illicitly, such as illegalgross domestic product\\n(GDP)the market value of all final goodsand services produced within acountry in a given period of timeCHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 209\\ndrugs. It also excludes most items that are produced and consumed at home and,\\ntherefore, never enter the marketplace. Vegetables you buy at the grocery store arepart of GDP; vegetables you grow in your garden are not.\\nThese exclusions from GDP can at times lead to paradoxical results. For exam-\\nple, when Karen pays Doug to mow her lawn, that transaction is part of GDP . IfKaren were to marry Doug, the situation would change. Even though Doug maycontinue to mow Karen’s lawn, the value of the mowing is now left out of GDPbecause Doug’s service is no longer sold in a market. Thus, when Karen and Dougmarry, GDP falls.\\n“FINAL . . .”\\nWhen International Paper makes paper, which Hallmark then uses to make agreeting card, the paper is called an intermediate good, and the card is called a final\\ngood. GDP includes only the value of final goods. The reason is that the value of\\nintermediate goods is already included in the prices of the final goods. Adding themarket value of the paper to the market value of the card would be double count-ing. That is, it would (incorrectly) count the paper twice.\\nAn important exception to this principle arises when an intermediate good is\\nproduced and, rather than being used, is added to a firm’s inventory of goods to beused or sold at a later date. In this case, the intermediate good is taken to be “final”for the moment, and its value as inventory investment is added to GDP . When theinventory of the intermediate good is later used or sold, the firm’s inventory invest-ment is negative, and GDP for the later period is reduced accordingly.\\n“GOODS AND SERVICES . . .”\\nGDP includes both tangible goods (food, clothing, cars) and intangible services(haircuts, housecleaning, doctor visits). When you buy a CD by your favoritesinging group, you are buying a good, and the purchase price is part of GDP .When you pay to hear a concert by the same group, you are buying a service, andthe ticket price is also part of GDP .\\n“PRODUCED . . .”\\nGDP includes goods and services currently produced. It does not include transac-tions involving items produced in the past. When General Motors produces andsells a new car, the value of the car is included in GDP . When one person sells aused car to another person, the value of the used car is not included in GDP .\\n“WITHIN A COUNTRY . . .”\\nGDP measures the value of production within the geographic confines of a coun-try. When a Canadian citizen works temporarily in the United States, his produc-tion is part of U.S. GDP . When an American citizen owns a factory in Haiti, theproduction at his factory is not part of U.S. GDP . (It is part of Haiti’s GDP .) Thus,items are included in a nation’s GDP if they are produced domestically, regardlessof the nationality of the producer.210 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\n“. . . IN A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME.”\\nGDP measures the value of production that takes place within a specific interval of\\ntime. Usually that interval is a year or a quarter (three months). GDP measures theeconomy’s flow of income and expenditure during that interval.\\nWhen the government reports the GDP for a quarter, it usually presents\\nGDP “at an annual rate.” This means that the figure reported for quarterly GDP isthe amount of income and expenditure during the quarter multiplied by 4. Thegovernment uses this convention so that quarterly and annual figures on GDP canbe compared more easily.\\nIn addition, when the government reports quarterly GDP , it presents the data\\nafter they have been modified by a statistical procedure called seasonal adjustment.\\nThe unadjusted data show clearly that the economy produces more goods andservices during some times of year than during others. (As you might guess,December’s Christmas shopping season is a high point.) When monitoring the\\nWhen the U.S. Department\\nof Commerce computes thenation’s GDP every threemonths, it also computes vari-ous other measures of incometo get a more complete pictureof what’s happening in the econ-omy. These other measures dif-fer from GDP by excluding orincluding certain categories ofincome. What follows is a briefdescription of five of theseincome measures, ordered fromlargest to smallest.\\nNGross national product (GNP) is the total income\\nearned by a nation’s permanent residents (callednationals ). It differs from GDP by including income that\\nour citizens earn abroad and excluding income that for-eigners earn here. For example, when a Canadian citi-zen works temporarily in the United States, hisproduction is part of U.S. GDP, but it is not part of U.S.GNP. (It is part of Canada’s GNP.) For most countries,including the United States, domestic residents areresponsible for most domestic production, so GDP andGNP are quite close.\\nNNet national product (NNP) is the total income of a\\nnation’s residents (GNP) minus losses from depreciation.Depreciation is the wear and tear on the economy’s\\nstock of equipment and structures, such as trucks rust-ing and lightbulbs burning out. In the national incomeaccounts prepared by the Department of Commerce,depreciation is called the “consumption of fixed capital.”NNational income is the total income earned by a\\nnation’s residents in the production of goods and ser-vices. It differs from net national product by excludingindirect business taxes (such as sales taxes) andincluding business subsidies. NNP and national incomealso differ because of a “statistical discrepancy” thatarises from problems in data collection.\\nNPersonal income is the income that households and\\nnoncorporate businesses receive. Unlike nationalincome, it excludes retained earnings, which is income\\nthat corporations have earned but have not paid out totheir owners. It also subtracts corporate income taxesand contributions for social insurance (mostly SocialSecurity taxes). In addition, personal income includesthe interest income that households receive from theirholdings of government debt and the income thathouseholds receive from government transfer pro-grams, such as welfare and Social Security.\\nNDisposable personal income is the income that house-\\nholds and noncorporate businesses have left after sat-isfying all their obligations to the government. It equalspersonal income minus personal taxes and certain non-tax payments (such as traffic tickets).\\nAlthough the various measures of income differ in detail,\\nthey almost always tell the same story about economic con-ditions. When GDP is growing rapidly, these other measuresof income are usually growing rapidly. And when GDP isfalling, these other measures are usually falling as well. Formonitoring fluctuations in the overall economy, it does notmatter much which measure of income we use.\\nFYI\\nOther Measures\\nof Income\\nCHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 211\\ncondition of the economy, economists and policymakers often want to look\\nbeyond these regular seasonal changes. Therefore, government statisticians adjustthe quarterly data to take out the seasonal cycle. The GDP data reported in thenews are always seasonally adjusted.\\nNow let’s repeat the definition of GDP:\\nNGross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and\\nservices produced within a country in a given period of time.\\nIt should be apparent that GDP is a sophisticated measure of the value of economic\\nactivity. In advanced courses in macroeconomics, you will learn more of the sub-tleties that arise in its calculation. But even now you can see that each phrase inthis definition is packed with meaning.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Which contributes more to GDP—the production of a pound \\nof hamburger or the production of a pound of caviar? Why?\\nTHE COMPONENTS OF GDP\\nSpending in the economy takes many forms. At any moment, the Smith family\\nmay be having lunch at Burger King; General Motors may be building a car facto-ry; the Navy may be procuring a submarine; and British Airways may be buyingan airplane from Boeing. GDP includes all of these various forms of spending ondomestically produced goods and services.\\nTo understand how the economy is using its scarce resources, economists are\\noften interested in studying the composition of GDP among various types of spend-ing. To do this, GDP (which we denote as Y) is divided into four components: con-\\nsumption ( C), investment ( I), government purchases ( G), and net exports ( NX):\\nY/H11005C/H11001I/H11001G/H11001NX.\\nThis equation is an identity —an equation that must be true by the way the vari-\\nables in the equation are defined. In this case, because each dollar of expenditureincluded in GDP is placed into one of the four components of GDP , the total of thefour components must be equal to GDP .\\nWe have just seen an example of each component. Consumption is spending\\nby households on goods and services, such as the Smiths’ lunch at Burger King.Investment is the purchase of capital equipment, inventories, and structures, such\\nas the General Motors factory. Investment also includes expenditure on new hous-ing. (By convention, expenditure on new housing is the one form of householdspending categorized as investment rather than consumption.) Government pur-\\nchases include spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal govern-\\nments, such as the Navy’s purchase of a submarine. Net exports equal the\\npurchases of domestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus thedomestic purchases of foreign goods (imports). A domestic firm’s sale to a buyer inanother country, such as the Boeing sale to British Airways, increases net exports.\\nThe “net” in “net exports” refers to the fact that imports are subtracted from\\nexports. This subtraction is made because imports of goods and services areconsumption\\nspending by households on goodsand services, with the exception ofpurchases of new housing\\ninvestment\\nspending on capital equipment,inventories, and structures,including household purchases ofnew housing\\ngovernment purchases\\nspending on goods and services bylocal, state, and federal governments\\nnet exports\\nspending on domestically producedgoods by foreigners (exports) minusspending on foreign goods bydomestic residents (imports)212 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nincluded in other components of GDP . For example, suppose that a household\\nbuys a $30,000 car from Volvo, the Swedish carmaker. That transaction increasesconsumption by $30,000 because car purchases are part of consumer spending. Italso reduces net exports by $30,000 because the car is an import. In other words,net exports include goods and services produced abroad (with a minus sign)because these goods and services are included in consumption, investment, andgovernment purchases (with a plus sign). Thus, when a domestic household, firm,or government buys a good or service from abroad, the purchase reduces netexports—but because it also raises consumption, investment, or government pur-chases, it does not affect GDP .\\nThe meaning of “government purchases” also requires a bit of clarification.\\nWhen the government pays the salary of an Army general, that salary is part ofgovernment purchases. But what happens when the government pays a SocialSecurity benefit to one of the elderly? Such government spending is called a trans-\\nfer payment because it is not made in exchange for a currently produced good or\\nservice. From a macroeconomic standpoint, transfer payments are like a tax rebate.Like taxes, transfer payments alter household income, but they do not reflect theeconomy’s production. Because GDP is intended to measure income from (andexpenditure on) the production of goods and services, transfer payments are notcounted as part of government purchases.\\nTable 10-1 shows the composition of U.S. GDP in 1998. In this year, the GDP of\\nthe United States was about $8.5 trillion. If we divide this number by the 1998 U.S.population of 270 million, we find that GDP per person—the amount of expendi-ture for the average American—was $31,522. Consumption made up about two-thirds of GDP , or $21,511 per person. Investment was $5,063 per person.Government purchases were $5,507 per person. Net exports were –$559 per per-son. This number is negative because Americans earned less from selling to for-eigners than they spent on foreign goods.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List the four components of expenditure. Which is the largest?\\nREAL VERSUS NOMINAL GDP\\nAs we have seen, GDP measures the total spending on goods and services in all\\nmarkets in the economy. If total spending rises from one year to the next, one oftwo things must be true: (1) the economy is producing a larger output of goodsTable 10-1\\nGDP AND ITSCOMPONENTS .\\nThis table shows total GDP forthe U.S. economy in 1998 and thebreakdown of GDP among itsfour components.

When\\nstudying changes in the economy over time, economists want to separate thesetwo effects. In particular, they want a measure of the total quantity of goods andservices the economy is producing that is not affected by changes in the prices ofthose goods and services.\\nTo do this, economists use a measure called real GDP . Real GDP answers a\\nhypothetical question: What would be the value of the goods and services pro-duced this year if we valued these goods and services at the prices that prevailedin some specific year in the past? By evaluating current production using pricesthat are fixed at past levels, real GDP shows how the economy’s overall produc-tion of goods and services changes over time.\\nTo see more precisely how real GDP is constructed, let’s consider an example.\\nA NUMERICAL EXAMPLE\\nTable 10-2 shows some data for an economy that produces only two goods—hotdogs and hamburgers. The table shows the quantities of the two goods producedand their prices in the years 2001, 2002, and 2003.Table 10-2PRICES AND QUANTITIES\\nYEAR PRICEOF HOTDOGS QUANTITY OF HOTDOGS PRICEOF HAMBURGERS QUANTITY OF HAMBURGERS\\n2001 $1 100 $2 50\\n2002 2 150 3 1002003 3 200 4 150\\nYEAR CALCULATING NOMINAL GDP\\n2001 ($1 per hot dog /H11003100 hot dogs) /H11001($2 per hamburger /H1100350 hamburgers) /H11005$200\\n2002 ($2 per hot dog /H11003150 hot dogs) /H11001($3 per hamburger /H11003100 hamburgers) /H11005$600\\n2003 ($3 per hot dog /H11003200 hot dogs) /H11001($4 per hamburger /H11003150 hamburgers) /H11005$1,200\\nYEAR CALCULATING REALGDP ( BASEYE AR 2001)\\n2001 ($1 per hot dog /H11003100 hot dogs) /H11001($2 per hamburger /H1100350 hamburgers) /H11005$200\\n2002 ($1 per hot dog /H11003150 hot dogs) /H11001($2 per hamburger /H11003100 hamburgers) /H11005$350\\n2003 ($1 per hot dog /H11003200 hot dogs) /H11001($2 per hamburger /H11003150 hamburgers) /H11005$500\\nYEAR CALCULATING THE GDP D EFLATOR\\n2001 ($200/$200) /H11003100 /H11005100\\n2002 ($600/$350) /H11003100 /H11005171\\n2003 ($1,200/$500) /H11003100 /H11005240\\nREAL AND NOMINAL GDP. This table shows how to calculate real GDP , nominal GDP ,\\nand the GDP deflator for a hypothetical economy that produces only hot dogs and\\nhamburgers.214 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nTo compute total spending in this economy, we would multiply the quantities\\nof hot dogs and hamburgers by their prices. In the year 2001, 100 hot dogs are soldat a price of $1 per hot dog, so expenditure on hot dogs equals $100. In the sameyear, 50 hamburgers are sold for $2 per hamburger, so expenditure on hamburgersalso equals $100. Total expenditure in the economy—the sum of expenditure onhot dogs and expenditure on hamburgers—is $200. This amount, the productionof goods and services valued at current prices, is called nominal GDP .\\nThe table shows the calculation of nominal GDP for these three years. Total\\nspending rises from $200 in 2001 to $600 in 2002 and then to $1,200 in 2003. Part ofthis rise is attributable to the increase in the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers,and part is attributable to the increase in the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers.\\nTo obtain a measure of the amount produced that is not affected by changes in\\nprices, we use real GDP , which is the production of goods and services valued at\\nconstant prices. We calculate real GDP by first choosing one year as a base year. We\\nthen use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in the base year to compute thevalue of goods and services in all of the years. In other words, the prices in thebase year provide the basis for comparing quantities in different years.\\nSuppose that we choose 2001 to be the base year in our example. We can then\\nuse the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 2001 to compute the value of goodsand services produced in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Table 10-2 shows these calculations.To compute real GDP for 2001, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in2001 (the base year) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced in2001. (Thus, for the base year, real GDP always equals nominal GDP .) To computereal GDP for 2002, we use the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers in 2001 (the baseyear) and the quantities of hot dogs and hamburgers produced in 2002. Similarly,to compute real GDP for 2003, we use the prices in 2001 and the quantities in 2003.When we find that real GDP has risen from $200 in 2001 to $350 in 2002 and thento $500 in 2003, we know that the increase is attributable to an increase in the quan-tities produced, because the prices are being held fixed at base-year levels.\\nTo sum up: Nominal GDP uses current prices to place a value on the economy’s pro-\\nduction of goods and services. Real GDP uses constant base-year prices to place a value onthe economy’s production of goods and services. Because real GDP is not affected by\\nchanges in prices, changes in real GDP reflect only changes in the amounts beingproduced. Thus, real GDP is a measure of the economy’s production of goods andservices.\\nOur goal in computing GDP is to gauge how well the overall economy is per-\\nforming. Because real GDP measures the economy’s production of goods and ser-vices, it reflects the economy’s ability to satisfy people’s needs and desires. Thus,real GDP is a better gauge of economic well-being than is nominal GDP . Wheneconomists talk about the economy’s GDP , they usually mean real GDP rather thannominal GDP . And when they talk about growth in the economy, they measurethat growth as the percentage change in real GDP from one period to another.\\nTHE GDP DEFLATOR\\nAs we have just seen, nominal GDP reflects both the prices of goods and servicesand the quantities of goods and services the economy is producing. By contrast, byholding prices constant at base-year levels, real GDP reflects only the quantitiesproduced. From these two statistics, we can compute a third, called the GDP defla-\\ntor, which reflects the prices of goods and services but not the quantities produced.nominal GDP\\nthe production of goods and servicesvalued at current prices\\nreal GDP\\nthe production of goods and servicesvalued at constant pricesCHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 215\\nCASE STUDY REAL GDP OVER RECENT HISTORY\\nNow that we know how real GDP is defined and measured, let’s look at what this\\nmacroeconomic variable tells us about the recent history of the United States. Fig-ure 10-2 shows quarterly data on real GDP for the U.S. economy since 1970.The GDP deflator is calculated as follows:\\nGDP deflator /H11005/H11003 100.\\nBecause nominal GDP and real GDP must be the same in the base year, the GDP\\ndeflator for the base year always equals 100. The GDP deflator for subsequentyears measures the rise in nominal GDP from the base year that cannot be attrib-utable to a rise in real GDP .\\nThe GDP deflator measures the current level of prices relative to the level of\\nprices in the base year. To see why this is true, consider a couple of simple exam-ples. First, imagine that the quantities produced in the economy rise over time butprices remain the same. In this case, both nominal and real GDP rise together, sothe GDP deflator is constant. Now suppose, instead, that prices rise over time butthe quantities produced stay the same. In this second case, nominal GDP rises butreal GDP remains the same, so the GDP deflator rises as well. Notice that, in bothcases, the GDP deflator reflects what’s happening to prices, not quantities.\\nLet’s now return to our numerical example in Table 10-2. The GDP deflator is\\ncomputed at the bottom of the table. For year 2001, nominal GDP is $200, and realGDP is $200, so the GDP deflator is 100. For the year 2002, nominal GDP is $600,and real GDP is $350, so the GDP deflator is 171. Because the GDP deflator rose inyear 2002 from 100 to 171, we can say that the price level increased by 71 percent.\\nThe GDP deflator is one measure that economists use to monitor the average\\nlevel of prices in the economy. We examine another—the consumer price index—inthe next chapter, where we also describe the differences between the two measures.Nominal GDP\\nReal GDPGDP deflator\\na measure of the price levelcalculated as the ratio of nominalGDP to real GDP times 100\\nBillions of\\n1992 Dollars\\n3,0004,0005,0006,000$8,000\\n$7,000\\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 2000 1995Figure 10-2\\nREAL GDP IN THE UNITED\\nSTATES . This figure shows\\nquarterly data on real GDP forthe U.S. economy since 1970.Recessions—periods of fallingreal GDP—are marked with theshaded vertical bars.\\nSOURCE : U.S. Department of Commerce.216 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nThe most obvious feature of these data is that real GDP grows over time.\\nThe real GDP of the U.S. economy in 1999 was more than twice its 1970 level.Put differently, the output of goods and services produced in the United Stateshas grown on average about 3 percent per year since 1970. This continuedgrowth in real GDP enables the typical American to enjoy greater economicprosperity than his or her parents and grandparents did.\\nA second feature of the GDP data is that growth is not steady. The upward\\nclimb of real GDP is occasionally interrupted by periods during which GDPdeclines, called recessions. Figure 10-2 marks recessions with shaded vertical\\nbars. (There is no ironclad rule for when the official business cycle dating com-mittee will declare that a recession has occurred, but a good rule of thumb istwo consecutive quarters of falling real GDP .) Recessions are associated not onlywith lower incomes but also with other forms of economic distress: risingunemployment, falling profits, increased bankruptcies, and so on.\\nMuch of macroeconomics is aimed at explaining the long-run growth\\nand short-run fluctuations in real GDP . As we will see in the coming chap-ters, we need different models for these two purposes. Because the short-runfluctuations represent deviations from the long-run trend, we first examine thebehavior of the economy in the long run. In particular, Chapters 12 through 18examine how key macroeconomic variables, including real GDP , are deter-mined in the long run. We then build on this analysis to explain short-run fluc-tuations in Chapters 19 through 21.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define real and nominal GDP . Which is a better measure of \\neconomic well-being? Why?\\nGDP AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING\\nEarlier in this chapter, GDP was called the best single measure of the economic well-\\nbeing of a society. Now that we know what GDP is, we can evaluate this claim.\\nAs we have seen, GDP measures both the economy’s total income and the econ-\\nomy’s total expenditure on goods and services. Thus, GDP per person tells us theincome and expenditure of the average person in the economy. Because most peoplewould prefer to receive higher income and enjoy higher expenditure, GDP per per-son seems a natural measure of the economic well-being of the average individual.\\nYet some people dispute the validity of GDP as a measure of well-being. When\\nSenator Robert Kennedy was running for president in 1968, he gave a moving cri-tique of such economic measures:\\n[Gross domestic product] does not allow for the health of our children, the\\nquality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beautyof our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our publicdebate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our courage,nor our wisdom, nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, inshort, except that which makes life worthwhile, and it can tell us everythingabout America except why we are proud that we are Americans.CHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 217\\nMuch of what Robert Kennedy said is correct. Why then do we care about GDP?\\nThe answer is that a large GDP does in fact help us to lead a good life. GDP\\ndoes not measure the health of our children, but nations with larger GDP canafford better health care for their children. GDP does not measure the quality oftheir education, but nations with larger GDP can afford better educational sys-tems. GDP does not measure the beauty of our poetry, but nations with larger GDPcan afford to teach more of their citizens to read and to enjoy poetry. GDP does nottake account of our intelligence, integrity, courage, wisdom, or devotion to coun-try, but all of these laudable attributes are easier to foster when people are less con-cerned about being able to afford the material necessities of life. In short, GDP doesnot directly measure those things that make life worthwhile, but it does measureour ability to obtain the inputs into a worthwhile life.GDP measures the value of the econ-\\nomy’s output of goods and services.What do you think we would learn if,instead, we measured the weight of theeconomy’s output?\\nFrom Greenspan, a (Truly)\\nWeighty Idea\\nBYDAVIDWESSEL\\nHaving weighed the evidence carefully,\\nFederal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan wants you to know that theU.S. economy is getting lighter.\\nLiterally.When he refers to “downsizing” in\\nthis instance, Mr. Greenspan means thata dollar’s worth of the goods and ser-vices produced in the mighty U.S. econ-omy weighs a lot less than it used to,even after adjusting for inflation.\\nA modern 10-story office building,\\nhe says, weighs less than a 10-storybuilding erected in the late 19th century.With synthetic fibers, clothes weigh less.\\nAnd the electronics revolution has pro-duced televisions so light they can beworn on the wrist.\\nBy conventional measures, the [real]\\ngross domestic product—the value of allgoods and services produced in thenation—is five times as great as it was50 years ago. Yet “the physical weightof our gross domestic product is evi-dently only modestly higher than it was50 or 100 years ago,” Mr. Greenspantold an audience in Dallas recently.\\nWhen you think about it, it’s not so\\nsurprising that the economy is gettinglighter. An ever-growing proportion ofthe U.S. GDP consists of things thatdon’t weigh anything at all—lawyers’services, psychotherapy, e-mail, onlineinformation.\\nBut Mr. Greenspan has a way of\\nmaking the obvious sound profound.Only “a small fraction” of the nation’seconomic growth in the past severaldecades “represents growth in the ton-nage of physical materials—oil, coal,ores, wood, raw chemicals,” he hasobserved. “The remainder representsnew insights into how to rearrange thosephysical materials to better serve humanneeds.” . . .\\nThe incredible shrinking GDP helps\\nexplain why American workers can pro-duce more for each hour of work thanever before. . . . [It] also helps explain\\nwhy there is so much international tradethese days. “The . . . downsizing of out-put,” Mr. Greenspan said recently,“meant that products were easier andhence less costly to move, and mostespecially across national borders.” . . .\\n“The world of 1948 was vastly dif-\\nferent,” Mr. Greenspan observed a fewyears back. “The quintessential model ofindustry might in those days was thearray of vast, smoke-encased integratedsteel mills . . . on the shores of LakeMichigan. Output was things, big physi-cal things.”\\nToday, one exemplar of U.S. eco-\\nnomic might is Microsoft Corp., with itsalmost weightless output. “Virtuallyunimaginable a half-century ago was theextent to which concepts and ideaswould substitute for physical resourcesand human brawn in the production ofgoods and services,” he has said.\\nOf course, one thing Made in the\\nU.S. is heavier than it used to be: peo-ple. The National Institutes of Healthsays 22.3% of Americans are obese, upfrom 12.8% in the early 1960. But Mr.Greenspan doesn’t talk about that.\\nSOURCE : The Wall Street Journal, May 20, 1999,\\np. B1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nGDP Lightens Up218 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nCASE STUDY INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN GDP AND THE\\nQUALITY OF LIFE\\nOne way to gauge the usefulness of GDP as a measure of economic well-being\\nis to examine international data. Rich and poor countries have vastly differentlevels of GDP per person. If a large GDP leads to a higher standard of living,then we should observe GDP to be strongly correlated with measures of thequality of life. And, in fact, we do.\\nTable 10-3 shows 12 of the world’s most populous countries ranked in order\\nof GDP per person. The table also shows life expectancy (the expected life spanat birth) and literacy (the percentage of the adult population that can read).These data show a clear pattern. In rich countries, such as the United States,Japan, and Germany, people can expect to live into their late seventies, andalmost all of the population can read. In poor countries, such as Nigeria,Bangladesh, and Pakistan, people typically live only until their fifties or earlysixties, and only about half of the population is literate.\\nAlthough data on other aspects of the quality of life are less complete, they\\ntell a similar story. Countries with low GDP per person tend to have moreinfants with low birth weight, higher rates of infant mortality, higher rates ofGDP is not, however, a perfect measure of well-being. Some things that con-\\ntribute to a good life are left out of GDP . One is leisure. Suppose, for instance, thateveryone in the economy suddenly started working every day of the week, ratherthan enjoying leisure on weekends. More goods and services would be produced,and GDP would rise. Yet, despite the increase in GDP , we should not conclude thateveryone would be better off. The loss from reduced leisure would offset the gainfrom producing and consuming a greater quantity of goods and services.\\nBecause GDP uses market prices to value goods and services, it excludes the\\nvalue of almost all activity that takes place outside of markets. In particular, GDPomits the value of goods and services produced at home. When a chef prepares adelicious meal and sells it at his restaurant, the value of that meal is part of GDP .But if the chef prepares the same meal for his spouse, the value he has added to theraw ingredients is left out of GDP . Similarly, child care provided in day care cen-ters is part of GDP , whereas child care by parents at home is not. Volunteer workalso contributes to the well-being of those in society, but GDP does not reflect thesecontributions.\\nAnother thing that GDP excludes is the quality of the environment. Imagine\\nthat the government eliminated all environmental regulations. Firms could thenproduce goods and services without considering the pollution they create, andGDP might rise. Yet well-being would most likely fall. The deterioration in thequality of air and water would more than offset the gains from greater production.\\nGDP also says nothing about the distribution of income. A society in which\\n100 people have annual incomes of $50,000 has GDP of $5 million and, not sur-prisingly, GDP per person of $50,000. So does a society in which 10 people earn$500,000 and 90 suffer with nothing at all. Few people would look at those two sit-uations and call them equivalent. GDP per person tells us what happens to theaverage person, but behind the average lies a large variety of personal experiences.\\nIn the end, we can conclude that GDP is a good measure of economic well-\\nbeing for most—but not all—purposes.

Or consider vod-ka. Distillers are able to produce far morevodka than is officially being sold. But giv-en the well-deserved Russian fondness forvodka there is every reason to think thedistilleries are operating at full capacity.\\nThe Russian Government’s top\\nnumber crunchers say the contradictionsare easy to explain: high taxes, govern-ment red tape, and the simple desire tosock away some extra cash have drivenmuch of Russia’s economic activityunderground.\\nFor the last six years, the Russian\\neconomy has been going down, down,down. But as President Boris N. Yeltsintries to deliver the growth he haspromised, economists are taking a clos-er look at the murky but vibrant shadoweconomy. It includes everything fromsmall businesses that never report theirsales to huge companies that understatetheir production to avoid taxes.Government experts insist that if the\\nshadow economy is taken into account,the overall economy is finally starting togrow.

These countries also tend to have fewer televisions,fewer telephones, fewer paved roads, and fewer households with electricity.International data leave no doubt that a nation’s GDP is closely associated withits citizens’ standard of living.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Why should policymakers care about GDP?\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis chapter has discussed how economists measure the total income of a nation.\\nMeasurement is, of course, only a starting point. Much of macroeconomics isaimed at revealing the long-run and short-run determinants of a nation’s grossdomestic product. Why, for example, is GDP higher in the United States and Japanthan in India and Nigeria? What can the governments of the poorest countries doto promote more rapid growth in GDP? Why does GDP in the United States riserapidly in some years and fall in others? What can U.S. policymakers do to reducethe severity of these fluctuations in GDP? These are the questions we will take upshortly.\\nAt this point, it is important to acknowledge the importance of just measuring\\nGDP . We all get some sense of how the economy is doing as we go about our lives.But the economists who study changes in the economy and the policymakers whoformulate economic policies need more than this vague sense—they need concretedata on which to base their judgments. Quantifying the behavior of the economywith statistics such as GDP is, therefore, the first step to developing a science ofmacroeconomics.\\nN Because every transaction has a buyer and a seller, the\\ntotal expenditure in the economy must equal the totalincome in the economy.\\nN Gross domestic product (GDP) measures an economy’s\\ntotal expenditure on newly produced goods andservices and the total income earned from theproduction of these goods and services. More precisely,GDP is the market value of all final goods and servicesproduced within a country in a given period of time.\\nN GDP is divided among four components of expenditure:\\nconsumption, investment, government purchases, andnet exports. Consumption includes spending on goodsand services by households, with the exception ofpurchases of new housing. Investment includes\\nspending on new equipment and structures, includinghouseholds’ purchases of new housing. Governmentpurchases include spending on goods and services bylocal, state, and federal governments. Net exports equalthe value of goods and services produced domesticallyand sold abroad (exports) minus the value of goods andservices produced abroad and sold domestically(imports).\\nN Nominal GDP uses current prices to value the\\neconomy’s production of goods and services. Real GDPuses constant base-year prices to value the economy’sproduction of goods and services. The GDP deflator— SummaryCHAPTER 10 MEASURING A NATION’S INCOME 221\\ncalculated from the ratio of nominal to real GDP—\\nmeasures the level of prices in the economy.\\nN GDP is a good measure of economic well-being because\\npeople prefer higher to lower incomes. But it is not aperfect measure of well-being.

At the time, this salary was extraordi-nary, even among the stars of baseball. According to one story, a reporter askedRuth whether he thought it was right that he made more than President HerbertHoover, who had a salary of only $75,000. Ruth replied, “I had a better year.”\\nToday the average baseball player earns more than 10 times Ruth’s 1931 salary,\\nand the best players can earn 100 times as much. At first, this fact might lead youto think that baseball has become much more lucrative over the past six decades.But, as everyone knows, the prices of goods and services have also risen. In 1931,a nickel would buy an ice-cream cone, and a quarter would buy a ticket at the localmovie theater. Because prices were so much lower in Babe Ruth’s day than theyare in ours, it is not clear whether Ruth enjoyed a higher or lower standard of liv-ing than today’s players.MEASURING THE\\nCOST OF LIVING\\n224 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nIn the preceding chapter we looked at how economists use gross domestic\\nproduct (GDP) to measure the quantity of goods and services that the economy isproducing. This chapter examines how economists measure the overall cost of liv-ing. To compare Babe Ruth’s salary of $80,000 to salaries from today, we need tofind some way of turning dollar figures into meaningful measures of purchasingpower. That is exactly the job of a statistic called the consumer price index. After see-\\ning how the consumer price index is constructed, we discuss how we can use sucha price index to compare dollar figures from different points in time.\\nThe consumer price index is used to monitor changes in the cost of living over\\ntime. When the consumer price index rises, the typical family has to spend moredollars to maintain the same standard of living. Economists use the term inflation\\nto describe a situation in which the economy’s overall price level is rising. Theinflation rate is the percentage change in the price level from the previous period.\\nAs we will see in the coming chapters, inflation is a closely watched aspect ofmacroeconomic performance and is a key variable guiding macroeconomic policy.This chapter provides the background for that analysis by showing how econo-mists measure the inflation rate using the consumer price index.\\nTHE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX\\nThe consumer price index (CPI) is a measure of the overall cost of the goods and\\nservices bought by a typical consumer. Each month the Bureau of Labor Statistics,which is part of the Department of Labor, computes and reports the consumerprice index. In this section we discuss how the consumer price index is calculatedand what problems arise in its measurement. We also consider how this indexcompares to the GDP deflator, another measure of the overall level of prices, whichwe examined in the preceding chapter.\\nHOW THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX IS CALCULATED\\nWhen the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the consumer price index and theinflation rate, it uses data on the prices of thousands of goods and services. To seeexactly how these statistics are constructed, let’s consider a simple economy inwhich consumers buy only two goods—hot dogs and hamburgers. Table 11-1shows the five steps that the Bureau of Labor Statistics follows.\\n1.Fix the Basket. The first step in computing the consumer price index is to\\ndetermine which prices are most important to the typical consumer. If thetypical consumer buys more hot dogs than hamburgers, then the price of hotdogs is more important than the price of hamburgers and, therefore, shouldbe given greater weight in measuring the cost of living. The Bureau of LaborStatistics sets these weights by surveying consumers and finding the basketof goods and services that the typical consumer buys. In the example in thetable, the typical consumer buys a basket of 4 hot dogs and 2 hamburgers.consumer price\\nindex (CPI)a measure of the overall cost ofthe goods and services boughtby a typical consumerCHAPTER 11 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING 225\\n2.Find the Prices. The second step in computing the consumer price index is to\\nfind the prices of each of the goods and services in the basket for each pointin time. The table shows the prices of hot dogs and hamburgers for threedifferent years.\\n3.Compute the Basket’s Cost. The third step is to use the data on prices\\nto calculate the cost of the basket of goods and services at different times.The table shows this calculation for each of the three years. Notice that onlythe prices in this calculation change. By keeping the basket of goods thesame (4 hot dogs and 2 hamburgers), we are isolating the effects of pricechanges from the effect of any quantity changes that might be occurringat the same time.\\n4.Choose a Base Year and Compute the Index. The fourth step is to designate\\none year as the base year, which is the benchmark against which other yearsare compared. To calculate the index, the price of the basket of goods andTable 11-1\\nCALCULATING THE CONSUMER\\nPRICE INDEX AND THE INFLATION\\nRATE: ANEXAMPLE .

The resulting number is theconsumer price index.\\nIn the example in the table, the year 2001 is the base year. In this year,\\nthe basket of hot dogs and hamburgers costs $8. Therefore, the price of thebasket in all years is divided by $8 and multiplied by 100. The consumerprice index is 100 in 2001. (The index is always 100 in the base year.) Theconsumer price index is 175 in 2002. This means that the price of the basketin 2002 is 175 percent of its price in the base year. Put differently, a basketof goods that costs $100 in the base year costs $175 in 2002. Similarly, theconsumer price index is 250 in 2003, indicating that the price level in 2003is 250 percent of the price level in the base year.\\n5.Compute the Inflation Rate. The fifth and final step is to use the consumer price\\nindex to calculate the inflation rate, which is the percentage change in the\\nprice index from the preceding period. That is, the inflation rate between twoconsecutive years is computed as follows:\\ninflation rate\\nthe percentage change in the priceindex from the preceding period\\nWhen constructing the con-\\nsumer price index, the Bureauof Labor Statistics tries toinclude all the goods and ser-vices that the typical consumerbuys. Moreover, it tries toweight these goods and ser-vices according to how muchconsumers buy of each item.\\nFigure 11-1 shows the\\nbreakdown of consumer spend-ing into the major categories ofgoods and services. By far the\\nlargest category is housing, which makes up 40 percent ofthe typical consumer’s budget. This category includes thecost of shelter (30 percent), fuel and other utilities (5 per-cent), and household furnishings and operation (5 percent).The next largest category, at 17 percent, is transportation,which includes spending on cars, gasoline, buses, subways,and so on. The next category, at 16 percent, is food andbeverages; this includes food at home (9 percent), foodaway from home (6 percent), and alcoholic beverages (1 per-cent). Next are medical care at 6 percent, recreation at 6percent, apparel at 5 percent, and education and communi-cation at 5 percent. This last category includes, for exam-ple, college tuition and personal computers.\\nAlso included in the figure, at 5 percent of spending, is\\na category for other goods and services. This is a catchallfor things consumers buy that do not naturally fit into theother categories, such as cigarettes, haircuts, and funeralexpenses.FYI\\nWhat Is in the\\nCPI’s Basket? 16%\\nFood and\\nbeverages\\n17%\\nTransportation\\nOther goods\\nand servicesMedical care\\nApparelRecreation\\n5%6%\\n5%5%6%40%\\nHousing\\nEducation and \\ncommunication\\nFigure 11-1\\nTHETYPICAL BASKET OF GOODS AND SERVICES .

The BLS collects and processes data on the prices ofthousands of goods and services every month and, by following the five foregoingsteps, determines how quickly the cost of living for the typical consumer is rising.When the bureau makes its monthly announcement of the consumer price index,you can usually hear the number on the evening television news or see it in thenext day’s newspaper.\\nIn addition to the consumer price index for the overall economy, the BLS cal-\\nculates several other price indexes. It reports the index for specific regions withinthe country (such as Boston, New York, and Los Angeles) and for some narrowcategories of goods and services (such as food, clothing, and energy). It also calcu-lates the producer price index, which measures the cost of a basket of goods and\\nservices bought by firms rather than consumers. Because firms eventually pass ontheir costs to consumers in the form of higher consumer prices, changes in the pro-ducer price index are often thought to be useful in predicting changes in the con-sumer price index.\\nPROBLEMS IN MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING\\nThe goal of the consumer price index is to measure changes in the cost of living. Inother words, the consumer price index tries to gauge how much incomes must risein order to maintain a constant standard of living. The consumer price index, how-ever, is not a perfect measure of the cost of living. Three problems with the indexare widely acknowledged but difficult to solve.\\nThe first problem is called substitution bias. When prices change from one year\\nto the next, they do not all change proportionately: Some prices rise by more thanothers. Consumers respond to these differing price changes by buying less of thegoods whose prices have risen by large amounts and by buying more of the goodswhose prices have risen less or perhaps even have fallen. That is, consumers sub-stitute toward goods that have become relatively less expensive. Yet the consumerprice index is computed assuming a fixed basket of goods. By not taking intoaccount the possibility of consumer substitution, the index overstates the increasein the cost of living from one year to the next.\\nLet’s consider a simple example. Imagine that in the base year, apples are\\ncheaper than pears, and so consumers buy more apples than pears. When theBureau of Labor Statistics constructs the basket of goods, it will include moreapples than pears. Suppose that next year pears are cheaper than apples. Con-sumers will naturally respond to the price changes by buying more pears and few-er apples. Yet, when computing the consumer price index, the Bureau of LaborStatistics uses a fixed basket, which in essence assumes that consumers continuebuying the now expensive apples in the same quantities as before. For this reason,the index will measure a much larger increase in the cost of living than consumersactually experience.CPI in year 2 /H11002CPI in year 1\\nCPI in year 1\\nproducer price index\\na measure of the cost of a basket ofgoods and services bought by firms228 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nThe second problem with the consumer price index is the introduction of new\\ngoods. When a new good is introduced, consumers have more variety from which\\nto choose. Greater variety, in turn, makes each dollar more valuable, so consumersneed fewer dollars to maintain any given standard of living. Yet because the con-sumer price index is based on a fixed basket of goods and services, it does notreflect this change in the purchasing power of the dollar.\\nAgain, let’s consider an example. When VCRs were introduced, consumers\\nwere able to watch their favorite movies at home. Compared to going to a movietheater, the convenience is greater and the cost is less. A perfect cost-of-living indexwould reflect the introduction of the VCR with a decrease in the cost of living. Theconsumer price index, however, did not decrease in response to the introduction ofthe VCR. Eventually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics did revise the basket of goodsBEHIND EVERY MACROECONOMIC STATISTIC\\nare thousands of individual pieces of\\ndata on the economy.

Mrs.Bloom’s fast talk finally pries the womanfrom behind her desk, and she gets thenumbers. It turns out that a semiprivatesurgery recovery room now costs$753.80 a day—or $0.04 less than amonth ago.\\nChalk up another small success for\\nMrs. Bloom, one of about 300 Bureau ofLabor Statistics employees who gatherthe information that is fed into themonthly Consumer Price Index. . . .\\nMrs. Bloom’s travails sometimes\\nread like a detective novel.

If prices change,she needs to find out why. Each month,some 90,000 prices are shipped toWashington, plugged into a computer,scrutinized, aggregated, adjusted forseasonal ups or downs, and then spitout as the monthly CPI report.\\nChoosing what to price—for ex-\\nample, the “regular” or “fancy” babyparakeet—can seem arbitrary. After con-sulting surveys that track consumer buy-ing habits, the labor statistics bureauselects popular stores and item cate-\\ngories—say, women’s tops. The price-taker then asks a store employee to helpzero in on an item of the price-taker’schoosing. They narrow to the size of thetop, its style (short-sleeve, long-sleeve,tank, or turtleneck), and so on; itemsthat generate the most revenue in a cat-egory have the best chance of gettingpicked.\\nShoppers know that relying on\\nemployees for anything can be chancy.At a downtown Chicago departmentstore (the government doesn’t disclose\\nIN THE NEWS\\nShopping for the CPI\\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS\\nBIASES THE CPI.\\nCHAPTER 11 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING 229\\nto include VCRs, and subsequently the index reflected changes in VCR prices. But\\nthe reduction in the cost of living associated with the initial introduction of theVCR never showed up in the index.\\nThe third problem with the consumer price index is unmeasured quality change.\\nIf the quality of a good deteriorates from one year to the next, the value of a dollarfalls, even if the price of the good stays the same. Similarly, if the quality rises fromone year to the next, the value of a dollar rises. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesits best to account for quality change. When the quality of a good in the basketchanges—for example, when a car model has more horsepower or gets better gasmileage from one year to the next—the BLS adjusts the price of the good toaccount for the quality change. It is, in essence, trying to compute the price of abasket of goods of constant quality. Despite these efforts, changes in qualityremain a problem, because quality is so hard to measure.names) price-taker Mary Ann Latter\\nsquints at a sale sign above an ivoryshell blouse. “Save 45%–60% when youtake an additional 30% off permanentlyreduced merchandise.

A1.230 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nThere is still much debate among economists about how severe these mea-\\nsurement problems are and what should be done about them. The issue is impor-tant because many government programs use the consumer price index to adjustfor changes in the overall level of prices. Recipients of Social Security, for instance,get annual increases in benefits that are tied to the consumer price index. Someeconomists have suggested modifying these programs to correct for the measure-ment problems. For example, most studies conclude that the consumer price indexoverstates inflation by about 1 percentage point per year (although recentimprovements in the CPI have reduced this upward bias somewhat). In responseto these findings, Congress could change the Social Security program so that ben-efits increased every year by the measured inflation rate minus 1 percentage point.Such a change would provide a crude way of offsetting the measurement prob-lems and, at the same time, reduce government spending by billions of dollarseach year.\\nALTHOUGH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX\\nmay overstate the true rate of inflation\\nfacing the typical consumer, it mayunderstate inflation for certain types ofconsumers. In particular, according tosome economists, the elderly haveexperienced more rapid cost-of-livingincreases than the general population.\\nPrices That \\nDon’t Fit the Profile: \\nIs Index Mismatched to \\nRetirees’ Reality?\\nBYLAURA CASTANEDA\\nLow inflation, a driving force behind the\\nnation’s economic boom, is having theperverse effect of making life harder for\\nmillions of elderly Americans.\\nThat is because increases in Social\\nSecurity payments are based on an infla-tion index—the Consumer Price Indexfor Urban Wage Earners and ClericalWorkers—that may not accuratelyreflect their expenses.\\nBased on that index, monthly Social\\nSecurity payments will rise an average of1.3 percent next year. But the costs thatdrain the resources of many retiredpeople—notably medical treatment, pre-scription drugs, and special housing—are rising faster than consumer prices ingeneral. . . .\\nNow the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\\nwhich calculates the indexes, hasdevised an experimental index that doestrack some spending habits of olderAmericans, and it has shown a wideninggap between cost increases for themand those for the general population.Between December 1982 and Septem-ber 1998, the experimental index rose73.9 percent, while the official indexrose 63.5 percent, said Patrick Jack-man, an economist at the bureau. . . .The official index “is understating\\nthe true rate of inflation for the elderly,”said Dean Baker, an economist at theEconomic Policy Institute, an indepen-dent research organization in Washing-ton, and the disparity is likely to getworse over time.\\nBut Mr. Baker, the author of\\n“Getting Prices Right: The Battle Overthe Consumer Price Index,” said olderpeople’s higher spending on somegoods and services was not the onlyreason. The official index also considersprice declines for consumer goods thatthey rarely buy, like television sets andcomputers.\\nWhile Congress balks at the cost,\\nhe added, a separate CPI for the elderly“would be the way to go” to correct theproblem.\\nSOURCE :The New York Times, Business Section,\\nNovember 8, 1998, p. 10.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nA CPI for Senior CitizensCHAPTER 11 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING 231\\nTHE GDP DEFLATOR VERSUS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX\\nIn the preceding chapter, we examined another measure of the overall level of\\nprices in the economy—the GDP deflator. The GDP deflator is the ratio of nominalGDP to real GDP . Because nominal GDP is current output valued at current pricesand real GDP is current output valued at base-year prices, the GDP deflatorreflects the current level of prices relative to the level of prices in the base year.\\nEconomists and policymakers monitor both the GDP deflator and the con-\\nsumer price index to gauge how quickly prices are rising. Usually, these two sta-tistics tell a similar story. Yet there are two important differences that can causethem to diverge.\\nThe first difference is that the GDP deflator reflects the prices of all goods and\\nservices produced domestically, whereas the consumer price index reflects the prices\\nof all goods and services bought by consumers. For example, suppose that the price\\nof an airplane produced by Boeing and sold to the Air Force rises. Even though theplane is part of GDP , it is not part of the basket of goods and services bought by atypical consumer. Thus, the price increase shows up in the GDP deflator but not inthe consumer price index.\\nAs another example, suppose that Volvo raises the price of its cars. Because\\nVolvos are made in Sweden, the car is not part of U.S. GDP . But U.S. consumersbuy Volvos, and so the car is part of the typical consumer’s basket of goods.Hence, a price increase in an imported consumption good, such as a Volvo, showsup in the consumer price index but not in the GDP deflator.\\nThis first difference between the consumer price index and the GDP deflator\\nis particularly important when the price of oil changes. Although the UnitedStates does produce some oil, much of the oil we use is imported from theMiddle East. As a result, oil and oil products such as gasoline and heating oilcomprise a much larger share of consumer spending than they do of GDP . Whenthe price of oil rises, the consumer price index rises by much more than does theGDP deflator.\\nThe second and more subtle difference between the GDP deflator and the con-\\nsumer price index concerns how various prices are weighted to yield a singlenumber for the overall level of prices. The consumer price index compares theprice of a fixed basket of goods and services to the price of the basket in the base\\nyear. Only occasionally does the Bureau of Labor Statistics change the basket ofgoods. By contrast, the GDP deflator compares the price of currently produced\\ngoods and services to the price of the same goods and services in the base year.Thus, the group of goods and services used to compute the GDP deflator changesautomatically over time. This difference is not important when all prices arechanging proportionately. But if the prices of different goods and services arechanging by varying amounts, the way we weight the various prices matters forthe overall inflation rate.\\nFigure 11-2 shows the inflation rate as measured by both the GDP deflator and\\nthe consumer price index for each year since 1965. You can see that sometimes thetwo measures diverge. When they do diverge, it is possible to go behind thesenumbers and explain the divergence with the two differences we have discussed.The figure shows, however, that divergence between these two measures is theexception rather than the rule. In the late 1970s, both the GDP deflator and the con-sumer price index show high rates of inflation. In the late 1980s and 1990s, bothmeasures show low rates of inflation.232 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nQUICK QUIZ: Explain briefly what the consumer price index is trying to\\nmeasure and how it is constructed.\\nCORRECTING ECONOMIC VARIABLES FOR THE\\nEFFECTS OF INFLATION\\nThe purpose of measuring the overall level of prices in the economy is to permit\\ncomparison between dollar figures from different points in time. Now that weknow how price indexes are calculated, let’s see how we might use such an indexto compare a dollar figure from the past to a dollar figure in the present.\\nDOLLAR FIGURES FROM DIFFERENT TIMES\\nWe first return to the issue of Babe Ruth’s salary. Was his salary of $80,000 in 1931high or low compared to the salaries of today’s players?\\nTo answer this question, we need to know the level of prices in 1931 and the\\nlevel of prices today. Part of the increase in baseball salaries just compensates play-ers for the higher level of prices today. To compare Ruth’s salary to those of today’splayers, we need to inflate Ruth’s salary to turn 1931 dollars into today’s dollars.A price index determines the size of this inflation correction.1965Percent\\nper Year\\n15\\nCPI\\nGDP deflator10\\n5\\n0\\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1998 1995Figure 11-2\\nTWOMEASURES OF INFLATION .\\nThis figure shows the inflationrate—the percentage change inthe level of prices—as measuredby the GDP deflator and theconsumer price index usingannual data since 1965.

INDEX GOES TO HOLLYWOOD\\nWhat was the most popular movie of all time? The answer might surprise you.\\nMovie popularity is usually gauged by box office receipts. By that measure,\\nTitanic is the No. 1 movie of all time, followed by Star Wars, Star Wars: The\\nPhantom Menace, and ET.But this ranking ignores an obvious but important\\nfact: Prices, including the price of movie tickets, have been rising over time.When we correct box office receipts for the effects of inflation, the story is verydifferent.\\nTable 11-2 shows the top ten movies of all time, ranked by inflation-\\nadjusted box office receipts. The No. 1 movie is Gone with the Wind, which was\\nreleased in 1939 and is well ahead of Titanic. In the 1930s, before everyone had\\ntelevisions in their homes, about 90 million Americans went to the cinema eachweek, compared to about 25 million today. But the movies from that era rarelyshow up in popularity rankings because ticket prices were only a quarter. Scar-lett and Rhett fare a lot better once we correct for the effects of inflation.Government statistics show a consumer price index of 15.2 for 1931 and 166\\nfor 1999. Thus, the overall level of prices has risen by a factor of 10.9 (which equals166/15.2). We can use these numbers to measure Ruth’s salary in 1999 dollars. Thecalculation is as follows:\\nSalary in 1999 dollars /H11005Salary in 1931 dollars /H11003\\n/H11005$80,000 /H11003\\n/H11005$873,684.\\nWe find that Babe Ruth’s 1931 salary is equivalent to a salary today of just under\\n$1 million. That is not a bad income, but it is less than the salary of the averagebaseball player today, and it is far less than the amount paid to today’s baseballsuperstars. Chicago Cubs hitter Sammy Sosa, for instance, was paid about $10 mil-lion in 1999.\\nLet’s also examine President Hoover’s 1931 salary of $75,000. To translate that\\nfigure into 1999 dollars, we again multiply the ratio of the price levels in the twoyears. We find that Hoover’s salary is equivalent to $75,000 /H11003(166/15.2), or\\n$819,079, in 1999 dollars. This is well above President Clinton’s salary of $200,000(and even above the $400,000 salary that, according to recent legislation, will bepaid to Clinton’s successor). It seems that President Hoover did have a pretty goodyear after all.166\\n15.2Price level in 1999Price level in 1931\\nINDEXATION\\nAs we have just seen, price indexes are used to correct for the effects of inflation\\nwhen comparing dollar figures from different times. This type of correction showsup in many places in the economy. When some dollar amount is automaticallycorrected for inflation by law or contract, the amount is said to be indexed for\\ninflation.indexation\\nthe automatic correction of a dollaramount for the effects of inflationby law or contract“FRANKLY , MY DEAR , I DON’T CARE MUCH\\nFOR THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION .”\\n234 PART FOUR THE DATA OF MACROECONOMICS\\nFor example, many long-term contracts between firms and unions include\\npartial or complete indexation of the wage to the consumer price index. Such aprovision is called a cost-of-living allowance, or COLA. A COLA automatically raises\\nthe wage when the consumer price index rises.\\nIndexation is also a feature of many laws. Social Security benefits, for example,\\nare adjusted every year to compensate the elderly for increases in prices. Thebrackets of the federal income tax—the income levels at which the tax rateschange—are also indexed for inflation. There are, however, many ways in whichthe tax system is not indexed for inflation, even when perhaps it should be. Wediscuss these issues more fully when we discuss the costs of inflation later inthis book.\\nREAL AND NOMINAL INTEREST RATES\\nCorrecting economic variables for the effects of inflation is particularly important,and somewhat tricky, when we look at data on interest rates. When you deposityour savings in a bank account, you will earn interest on your deposit. Converse-ly, when you borrow from a bank to pay your tuition, you will pay interest on yourstudent loan. Interest represents a payment in the future for a transfer of money inthe past. As a result, interest rates always involve comparing amounts of money atdifferent points in time. To fully understand interest rates, we need to know howto correct for the effects of inflation.\\nLet’s consider an example. Suppose that Sally Saver deposits $1,000 in a bank\\naccount that pays an annual interest rate of 10 percent. After a year passes, Sallyhas accumulated $100 in interest. Sally then withdraws her $1,100. Is Sally $100richer than she was when she made the deposit a year earlier?\\nThe answer depends on what we mean by “richer.” Sally does have $100 more\\nthan she had before. In other words, the number of dollars has risen by 10 percent.But if prices have risen at the same time, each dollar now buys less than it did ayear ago. Thus, her purchasing power has not risen by 10 percent. If the inflationTable 11-2\\nTHEMOST POPULAR MOVIES OF\\nALLTIME, INFLATION ADJUSTEDYEAR OF TOTAL DOMESTIC GROSS\\nFILM RELEASE (IN MILLIONS OF 1999 DOLLARS )\\n1.Gone with the Wind 1939 $920\\n2.Star Wars 1977 798\\n3.The Sound of Music 1965 638\\n4.Titanic 1997 601\\n5.E.T.

And if the inflation rate was 15 percent, then the price of goods hasincreased proportionately more than the number of dollars in her account. In thatcase, Sally’s purchasing power has actually fallen by 5 percent.\\nThe interest rate that the bank pays is called the nominal interest rate, and the\\ninterest rate corrected for inflation is called the real interest rate. We can write the\\nrelationship among the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate, and inflation asfollows:\\nReal interest rate /H11005Nominal interest rate /H11002 Inflation rate.\\nThe real interest rate is the difference between the nominal interest rate and the\\nrate of inflation. The nominal interest rate tells you how fast the number of dollarsin your bank account rises over time. The real interest rate tells you how fast thepurchasing power of your bank account rises over time.\\nFigure 11-3 shows real and nominal interest rates since 1965. The nominal\\ninterest rate is the interest rate on three-month Treasury bills. The real interest rateis computed by subtracting inflation—the percentage change in the consumerprice index—from this nominal interest rate.\\nYou can see that real and nominal interest rates do not always move together.\\nFor example, in the late 1970s, nominal interest rates were high. But because infla-tion was very high, real interest rates were low. Indeed, in some years, real interestrates were negative, for inflation eroded people’s savings more quickly than nom-inal interest payments increased them. By contrast, in the late 1990s, nominal inter-est rates were low. But because inflation was also low, real interest rates wererelatively high.

If the\\nconsumer price index was 10 in 1914 and 166 in 1999, how much was the Fordpaycheck worth in 1999 dollars?\\nCONCLUSION\\n“A nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore,” baseball player Yogi Berra once quipped.Indeed, throughout recent history, the real values behind the nickel, the dime, andthe dollar have not been stable. Persistent increases in the overall level of priceshave been the norm. Such inflation reduces the purchasing power of each unit ofmoney over time. When comparing dollar figures from different times, it is impor-tant to keep in mind that a dollar today is not the same as a dollar 20 years ago or,most likely, 20 years from now.\\nThis chapter has discussed how economists measure the overall level of prices\\nin the economy and how they use price indexes to correct economic variables forthe effects of inflation. This analysis is only a starting point. We have not yet exam-ined the causes and effects of inflation or how inflation interacts with other eco-nomic variables. To do that, we need to go beyond issues of measurement. Indeed,that is our next task. Having explained how economists measure macroeconomicquantities and prices in the past two chapters, we are now ready to develop themodels that explain long-run and short-run movements in these variables.\\nSummary\\nN The consumer price index shows the cost of a basket of\\ngoods and services relative to the cost of the samebasket in the base year. The index is used to measure theoverall level of prices in the economy. The percentagechange in the consumer price index measures theinflation rate.\\nN The consumer price index is an imperfect measure of the\\ncost of living for three reasons. First, it does not takeinto account consumers’ ability to substitute towardgoods that become relatively cheaper over time. Second,it does not take into account increases in the purchasingpower of the dollar due to the introduction of newgoods. Third, it is distorted by unmeasured changes inthe quality of goods and services. Because of thesemeasurement problems, the CPI overstates annualinflation by about 1 percentage point.N Although the GDP deflator also measures the overall\\nlevel of prices in the economy, it differs from theconsumer price index because it includes goods andservices produced rather than goods and servicesconsumed. As a result, imported goods affect theconsumer price index but not the GDP deflator. Inaddition, whereas the consumer price index uses afixed basket of goods, the GDP deflator automaticallychanges the group of goods and services over time asthe composition of GDP changes.\\nN Dollar figures from different points in time do not\\nrepresent a valid comparison of purchasing power. Tocompare a dollar figure from the past to a dollar figuretoday, the older figure should be inflated using a priceindex.CHAPTER 11 MEASURING THE COST OF LIVING 237\\nN Various laws and private contracts use price indexes to\\ncorrect for the effects of inflation. The tax laws, however,are only partially indexed for inflation.\\nN A correction for inflation is especially important when\\nlooking at data on interest rates. The nominal interestrate is the interest rate usually reported; it is the rate atwhich the number of dollars in a savings account\\nincreases over time. By contrast, the real interest ratetakes into account changes in the value of the dollarover time. The real interest rate equals the nominalinterest rate minus the rate of inflation.\\nconsumer price index (CPI), p. 224inflation rate, p. 226producer price index, p. 227\\nindexation, p. 233nominal interest rate, p. 235\\nreal interest rate, p. 235\\n1.

The average person in a rich country, such as the United States, Japan, orGermany, has an income more than ten times as high as the average person in apoor country, such as India, Indonesia, or Nigeria. These large differences inincome are reflected in large differences in the quality of life. Richer countries havemore automobiles, more telephones, more televisions, better nutrition, safer hous-ing, better health care, and longer life expectancy.\\nEven within a country, there are large changes in the standard of living over\\ntime. In the United States over the past century, average income as measured byreal GDP per person has grown by about 2 percent per year. Although 2 percentmight seem small, this rate of growth implies that average income doubles every35 years. Because of this growth, average income today is about eight times as highas average income a century ago. As a result, the typical American enjoys muchPRODUCTION AND GROWTH\\n241242 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\ngreater economic prosperity than did his or her parents, grandparents, and great-\\ngrandparents.\\nGrowth rates vary substantially from country to country. In some East Asian\\ncountries, such as Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan, average income has risenabout 7 percent per year in recent decades. At this rate, average income doublesevery ten years. These countries have, in the length of one generation, gone frombeing among the poorest in the world to being among the richest. By contrast, insome African countries, such as Chad, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, average income hasbeen stagnant for many years.\\nWhat explains these diverse experiences? How can the rich countries be sure\\nto maintain their high standard of living? What policies should the poor countriespursue to promote more rapid growth in order to join the developed world? Theseare among the most important questions in macroeconomics. As economist RobertLucas put it, “The consequences for human welfare in questions like these are sim-ply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about any-thing else.”\\nIn the previous two chapters we discussed how economists measure macro-\\neconomic quantities and prices. In this chapter we start studying the forces thatdetermine these variables. As we have seen, an economy’s gross domestic product(GDP) measures both the total income earned in the economy and the total expen-diture on the economy’s output of goods and services. The level of real GDP is agood gauge of economic prosperity, and the growth of real GDP is a good gauge ofeconomic progress. Here we focus on the long-run determinants of the level andgrowth of real GDP . Later in this book we study the short-run fluctuations of realGDP around its long-run trend.\\nWe proceed here in three steps. First, we examine international data on real\\nGDP per person. These data will give you some sense of how much the level andgrowth of living standards vary around the world. Second, we examine the role ofproductivity —the amount of goods and services produced for each hour of a work-\\ner’s time. In particular, we see that a nation’s standard of living is determined bythe productivity of its workers, and we consider the factors that determine anation’s productivity. Third, we consider the link between productivity and theeconomic policies that a nation pursues.\\nECONOMIC GROWTH AROUND THE WORLD\\nAs a starting point for our study of long-run growth, let’s look at the experiencesof some of the world’s economies. Table 12-1 shows data on real GDP per personfor 13 countries. For each country, the data cover about a century of history. Thefirst and second columns of the table present the countries and time periods. (Thetime periods differ somewhat from country to country because of differences indata availability.) The third and fourth columns show estimates of real GDP perperson about a century ago and for a recent year.\\nThe data on real GDP per person show that living standards vary widely from\\ncountry to country. Income per person in the United States, for instance, is about 8times that in China and about 15 times that in India. The poorest countries haveaverage levels of income that have not been seen in the United States for manyCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 243\\ndecades. The typical citizen of China in 1997 had about as much real income as the\\ntypical American in 1870. The typical person in Pakistan in 1997 had about one-half the real income of a typical American a century ago.\\nThe last column of the table shows each country’s growth rate. The growth\\nrate measures how rapidly real GDP per person grew in the typical year. In theUnited States, for example, real GDP per person was $3,188 in 1870 and $28,740 in1997. The growth rate was 1.75 percent per year. This means that if real GDP perperson, beginning at $3,188, were to increase by 1.75 percent for each of 127 years,it would end up at $28,740. Of course, real GDP per person did not actually riseexactly 1.75 percent every year: Some years it rose by more and other years by less.The growth rate of 1.75 percent per year ignores short-run fluctuations around thelong-run trend and represents an average rate of growth for real GDP per personover many years.\\nThe countries in Table 12-1 are ordered by their growth rate from the most to\\nthe least rapid. Japan tops the list, with a growth rate of 2.82 percent per year. Ahundred years ago, Japan was not a rich country. Japan’s average income was onlysomewhat higher than Mexico’s, and it was well behind Argentina’s. To put theissue another way, Japan’s income in 1890 was less than India’s income in 1997.But because of its spectacular growth, Japan is now an economic superpower, withaverage income only slightly behind that of the United States. At the bottom of thelist of countries is Bangladesh, which has experienced growth of only 0.78 percentper year over the past century. As a result, the typical resident of Bangladesh con-tinues to live in abject poverty.\\nBecause of differences in growth rates, the ranking of countries by income\\nchanges substantially over time. As we have seen, Japan is a country that has risenTable 12-1REALGDP PERPERSON REALGDP PERPERSON GROWTH RATE\\nCOUNTRY PERIOD AT BEGINNING OF PERIODaATEND OF PERIODaPER YEAR\\nJapan 1890–1997 $1,196 $23,400 2.82%\\nBrazil 1900–1997 619 6,240 2.41Mexico 1900–1997 922 8,120 2.27Germany 1870–1997 1,738 21,300 1.99Canada 1870–1997 1,890 21,860 1.95China 1900–1997 570 3,570 1.91Argentina 1900–1997 1,824 9,950 1.76United States 1870–1997 3,188 28,740 1.75Indonesia 1900–1997 708 3,450 1.65India 1900–1997 537 1,950 1.34United Kingdom 1870–1997 3,826 20,520 1.33Pakistan 1900–1997 587 1,590 1.03\\nBangladesh 1900–1997 495 1,050 0.78\\naReal GDP is measured in 1997 dollars.\\nSOURCE : Robert J.

One country that has fallen behind is the United Kingdom. In\\n1870, the United Kingdom was the richest country in the world, with averageincome about 20 percent higher than that of the United States and about twice thatof Canada. Today, average income in the United Kingdom is below averageincome in its two former colonies.\\nThese data show that the world’s richest countries have no guarantee they will\\nstay the richest and that the world’s poorest countries are not doomed forever toremain in poverty. But what explains these changes over time? Why do somecountries zoom ahead while others lag behind? These are precisely the questionsthat we take up next.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What is the approximate growth rate of real GDP per person\\nin the United States? Name a country that has had faster growth and a countrythat has had slower growth.\\nPRODUCTIVITY: ITS ROLE AND DETERMINANTS\\nExplaining the large variation in living standards around the world is, in onesense, very easy. As we will see, the explanation can be summarized in a singleword— productivity. But, in another sense, the international variation is deeply\\nIt may be tempting to dismiss\\ndifferences in growth rates asinsignificant. If one countrygrows at 1 percent while anoth-er grows at 3 percent, so what?What difference can 2 percentmake?\\nThe answer is: a big differ-\\nence. Even growth rates thatseem small when written in per-centage terms seem large afterthey are compounded for manyyears. Compounding refers to\\nthe accumulation of a growth\\nrate over a period of time.\\nConsider an example. Suppose that two college gradu-\\nates—Jerry and Elaine—both take their first jobs at the ageof 22 earning $30,000 a year. Jerry lives in an economywhere all incomes grow at 1 percent per year, while Elainelives in one where incomes grow at 3 percent per year.Straightforward calculations show what happens. Fortyyears later, when both are 62 years old, Jerry earns$45,000 a year, while Elaine earns $98,000. Because ofthat difference of 2 percentage points in the growth rate,Elaine’s salary is more than twice Jerry’s.An old rule of thumb, called the rule of 70, is helpful in\\nunderstanding growth rates and the effects of compounding.According to the rule of 70, if some variable grows at a rateof xpercent per year, then that variable doubles in approxi-\\nmately 70/ xyears. In Jerry’s economy, incomes grow at 1\\npercent per year, so it takes about 70 years for incomes todouble. In Elaine’s economy, incomes grow at 3 percent peryear, so it takes about 70/3, or 23, years for incomes todouble.\\nThe rule of 70 applies not only to a growing economy\\nbut also to a growing savings account. Here is an example:In 1791, Ben Franklin died and left $5,000 to be investedfor a period of 200 years to benefit medical students andscientific research. If this money had earned 7 percent peryear (which would, in fact, have been very possible to do),the investment would have doubled in value every 10 years.Over 200 years, it would have doubled 20 times. At the endof 200 years of compounding, the investment would havebeen worth 2\\n20/H11003$5,000, which is about $5 billion. (In fact,\\nFranklin’s $5,000 grew to only $2 million over 200 yearsbecause some of the money was spent along the way.)\\nAs these examples show, growth rates compounded\\nover many years can lead to some spectacular results. Thatis probably why Albert Einstein once called compounding“the greatest mathematical discovery of all time.”FYI\\nThe Magic of\\nCompounding\\nand the\\nRule of 70\\nCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 245\\npuzzling. To explain why incomes are so much higher in some countries than in\\nothers, we must look at the many factors that determine a nation’s productivity.\\nWHY PRODUCTIVITY IS SO IMPORTANT\\nLet’s begin our study of productivity and economic growth by developing a sim-ple model based loosely on Daniel DeFoe’s famous novel Robinson Crusoe. Robin-\\nson Crusoe, as you may recall, is a sailor stranded on a desert island. BecauseCrusoe lives alone, he catches his own fish, grows his own vegetables, and makeshis own clothes. We can think of Crusoe’s activities—his production and con-sumption of fish, vegetables, and clothing—as being a simple economy. By exam-ining Crusoe’s economy, we can learn some lessons that also apply to morecomplex and realistic economies.\\nWhat determines Crusoe’s standard of living? The answer is obvious. If Cru-\\nsoe is good at catching fish, growing vegetables, and making clothes, he lives well.If he is bad at doing these things, he lives poorly. Because Crusoe gets to consumeonly what he produces, his living standard is tied to his productive ability.\\nThe term productivity refers to the quantity of goods and services that a work-\\ner can produce for each hour of work. In the case of Crusoe’s economy, it is easy tosee that productivity is the key determinant of living standards and that growth inproductivity is the key determinant of growth in living standards. The more fishCrusoe can catch per hour, the more he eats at dinner. If Crusoe finds a better placeto catch fish, his productivity rises. This increase in productivity makes Crusoebetter off: He could eat the extra fish, or he could spend less time fishing anddevote more time to making other goods he enjoys.\\nThe key role of productivity in determining living standards is as true for\\nnations as it is for stranded sailors. Recall that an economy’s gross domestic prod-uct (GDP) measures two things at once: the total income earned by everyone in theeconomy and the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and ser-vices. The reason why GDP can measure these two things simultaneously is that,for the economy as a whole, they must be equal. Put simply, an economy’s incomeis the economy’s output.\\nLike Crusoe, a nation can enjoy a high standard of living only if it can produce\\na large quantity of goods and services. Americans live better than Nigeriansbecause American workers are more productive than Nigerian workers. TheJapanese have enjoyed more rapid growth in living standards than Argentineansbecause Japanese workers have experienced more rapidly growing productivity.Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1 is that a country’s stan-\\ndard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.\\nHence, to understand the large differences in living standards we observe\\nacross countries or over time, we must focus on the production of goods and ser-vices. But seeing the link between living standards and productivity is only thefirst step. It leads naturally to the next question: Why are some economies so muchbetter at producing goods and services than others?\\nHOW PRODUCTIVITY IS DETERMINED\\nAlthough productivity is uniquely important in determining Robinson Crusoe’sstandard of living, many factors determine Crusoe’s productivity. Crusoe will beproductivity\\nthe amount of goods and servicesproduced from each hour of aworker’s time\\n246 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nbetter at catching fish, for instance, if he has more fishing poles, if he has been\\ntrained in the best fishing techniques, if his island has a plentiful fish supply, andif he invents a better fishing lure. Each of these determinants of Crusoe’s pro-ductivity—which we can call physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and\\ntechnological knowledge —has a counterpart in more complex and realistic\\neconomies. Let’s consider each of these factors in turn.\\nPhysical Capital Workers are more productive if they have tools with\\nwhich to work. The stock of equipment and structures that are used to producegoods and services is called physical capital, or just capital. For example, when\\nwoodworkers make furniture, they use saws, lathes, and drill presses. More toolsallow work to be done more quickly and more accurately. That is, a worker withonly basic hand tools can make less furniture each week than a worker withsophisticated and specialized woodworking equipment.\\nAs you may recall from Chapter 2, the inputs used to produce goods and ser-\\nvices—labor, capital, and so on—are called the factors of production. An important\\nfeature of capital is that it is a produced factor of production. That is, capital is an\\ninput into the production process that in the past was an output from the produc-tion process. The woodworker uses a lathe to make the leg of a table. Earlier thelathe itself was the output of a firm that manufactures lathes. The lathe manu-facturer in turn used other equipment to make its product. Thus, capital is a factorof production used to produce all kinds of goods and services, including morecapital.\\nHuman Capital A second determinant of productivity is human capital.\\nHuman capital is the economist’s term for the knowledge and skills that workers\\nacquire through education, training, and experience. Human capital includes theskills accumulated in early childhood programs, grade school, high school, col-lege, and on-the-job training for adults in the labor force.\\nAlthough education, training, and experience are less tangible than lathes,\\nbulldozers, and buildings, human capital is like physical capital in many ways.Like physical capital, human capital raises a nation’s ability to produce goods andservices. Also like physical capital, human capital is a produced factor of pro-duction. Producing human capital requires inputs in the form of teachers, libraries,and student time. Indeed, students can be viewed as “workers” who have the im-portant job of producing the human capital that will be used in future production.\\nNatural Resources A third determinant of productivity is natural\\nresources. Natural resources are inputs into production that are provided by\\nnature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits. Natural resources take twoforms: renewable and nonrenewable. A forest is an example of a renewableresource. When one tree is cut down, a seedling can be planted in its place to beharvested in the future. Oil is an example of a nonrenewable resource. Because oilis produced by nature over many thousands of years, there is only a limited sup-ply. Once the supply of oil is depleted, it is impossible to create more.\\nDifferences in natural resources are responsible for some of the differences in\\nstandards of living around the world. The historical success of the United Stateswas driven in part by the large supply of land well suited for agriculture. Today,some countries in the Middle East, such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, are richphysical capital\\nthe stock of equipment andstructures that are used to producegoods and services\\nhuman capital\\nthe knowledge and skills thatworkers acquire through education,training, and experience\\nnatural resources\\nthe inputs into the production ofgoods and services that are providedby nature, such as land, rivers, andmineral depositsCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 247\\nsimply because they happen to be on top of some of the largest pools of oil in the\\nworld.\\nAlthough natural resources can be important, they are not necessary for an\\neconomy to be highly productive in producing goods and services. Japan, forinstance, is one of the richest countries in the world, despite having few naturalresources. International trade makes Japan’s success possible. Japan imports manyof the natural resources it needs, such as oil, and exports its manufactured goodsto economies rich in natural resources.\\nTechnological Knowledge A fourth determinant of productivity is tech-\\nnological knowledge —the understanding of the best ways to produce goods and\\nservices. A hundred years ago, most Americans worked on farms, because farmtechnology required a high input of labor in order to feed the entire population.Today, thanks to advances in the technology of farming, a small fraction of thepopulation can produce enough food to feed the entire country. This technologicalchange made labor available to produce other goods and services.\\nTechnological knowledge takes many forms. Some technology is common\\nknowledge—after it becomes used by one person, everyone becomes aware of it.For example, once Henry Ford successfully introduced production in assemblylines, other carmakers quickly followed suit. Other technology is proprietary—it isknown only by the company that discovers it. Only the Coca-Cola Company, forinstance, knows the secret recipe for making its famous soft drink. Still other tech-nology is proprietary for a short time. When a pharmaceutical company discoversa new drug, the patent system gives that company a temporary right to be thetechnological knowledge\\nsociety’s understanding of the bestways to produce goods and services\\nEconomists often use a pro-\\nduction function to describe the\\nrelationship between the quan-tity of inputs used in productionand the quantity of output fromproduction. For example, sup-pose Ydenotes the quantity of\\noutput, Lthe quantity of labor,\\nKthe quantity of physical capi-\\ntal, Hthe quantity of human\\ncapital, and Nthe quantity of\\nnatural resources. Then wemight write\\nY/H11005A F(L, K, H, N ),\\nwhere F( ) is a function that shows how the inputs are com-\\nbined to produce output. Ais a variable that reflects the\\navailable production technology. As technology improves, A\\nrises, so the economy produces more output from any givencombination of inputs.\\nMany production functions have a property called con-\\nstant returns to scale. If a production function has constant\\nreturns to scale, then a doubling of all the inputs causes theamount of output to double as well. Mathematically, we\\nwrite that a production function has constant returns toscale if, for any positive number x,\\nxY/H11005AF(xL, xK, xH, xN ).\\nA doubling of all inputs is represented in this equation by\\nx= 2. The right-hand side shows the inputs doubling, and\\nthe left-hand side shows output doubling.\\nProduction functions with constant returns to scale\\nhave an interesting implication. To see what it is, set x=\\n1/L.Then the equation above becomes\\nY/L/H11005AF(1,K/L, H/L, N/L ).\\nNotice that Y/Lis output per worker, which is a measure of\\nproductivity. This equation says that productivity depends onphysical capital per worker ( K/L), human capital per worker\\n(H/L), and natural resources per worker ( N/L). Productivity\\nalso depends on the state of technology, as reflected by thevariable A.Thus, this equation provides a mathematical\\nsummary of the four determinants of productivity we havejust discussed.FYI\\nThe Production\\nFunction\\n248 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nCASE STUDY ARE NATURAL RESOURCES\\nA LIMIT TO GROWTH?\\nThe world’s population is far larger today than it was a century ago, and many\\npeople are enjoying a much higher standard of living. A perennial debate con-cerns whether this growth in population and living standards can continue inthe future.\\nMany commentators have argued that natural resources provide a limit to\\nhow much the world’s economies can grow. At first, this argument might seemhard to ignore. If the world has only a fixed supply of nonrenewable naturalresources, how can population, production, and living standards continue togrow over time? Eventually, won’t supplies of oil and minerals start to run out?When these shortages start to occur, won’t they stop economic growth and, per-haps, even force living standards to fall?\\nDespite the apparent appeal of such arguments, most economists are less\\nconcerned about such limits to growth than one might guess. They argue thattechnological progress often yields ways to avoid these limits. If we comparethe economy today to the economy of the past, we see various ways in whichthe use of natural resources has improved. Modern cars have better gasmileage. New houses have better insulation and require less energy to heat andcool them. More efficient oil rigs waste less oil in the process of extraction. Recy-cling allows some nonrenewable resources to be reused. The development ofalternative fuels, such as ethanol instead of gasoline, allows us to substituterenewable for nonrenewable resources.\\nFifty years ago, some conservationists were concerned about the excessive\\nuse of tin and copper. At the time, these were crucial commodities: Tin was usedto make many food containers, and copper was used to make telephone wire.Some people advocated mandatory recycling and rationing of tin and copper sothat supplies would be available for future generations. Today, however, plastichas replaced tin as a material for making many food containers, and phone callsoften travel over fiber-optic cables, which are made from sand. Technologicalprogress has made once crucial natural resources less necessary.\\nBut are all these efforts enough to permit continued economic growth? One\\nway to answer this question is to look at the prices of natural resources. In amarket economy, scarcity is reflected in market prices. If the world were run-ning out of natural resources, then the prices of those resources would be risingexclusive manufacturer of this particular drug. When the patent expires, however,other companies are allowed to make the drug. All these forms of technologicalknowledge are important for the economy’s production of goods and services.\\nIt is worthwhile to distinguish between technological knowledge and human\\ncapital. Although they are closely related, there is an important difference. Tech-nological knowledge refers to society’s understanding about how the worldworks. Human capital refers to the resources expended transmitting this under-standing to the labor force. To use a relevant metaphor, knowledge is the quality ofsociety’s textbooks, whereas human capital is the amount of time that the popula-tion has devoted to reading them. Workers’ productivity depends on both thequality of textbooks they have available and the amount of time they have spentstudying them.CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 249\\nover time. But, in fact, the opposite is more nearly true. The prices of most nat-\\nural resources (adjusted for overall inflation) are stable or falling. It appears thatour ability to conserve these resources is growing more rapidly than their sup-plies are dwindling. Market prices give no reason to believe that naturalresources are a limit to economic growth.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and describe four determinants of a country’s\\nproductivity.\\nECONOMIC GROWTH AND PUBLIC POLICY\\nSo far, we have determined that a society’s standard of living depends on its abili-ty to produce goods and services and that its productivity depends on physicalcapital, human capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge. Let’s nowturn to the question faced by policymakers around the world: What can govern-ment policy do to raise productivity and living standards?\\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT\\nBecause capital is a produced factor of production, a society can change theamount of capital it has. If today the economy produces a large quantity of newcapital goods, then tomorrow it will have a larger stock of capital and be able toproduce more of all types of goods and services. Thus, one way to raise future pro-ductivity is to invest more current resources in the production of capital.\\nOne of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people face\\ntradeoffs. This principle is especially important when considering the accumula-tion of capital. Because resources are scarce, devoting more resources to producingcapital requires devoting fewer resources to producing goods and services for cur-rent consumption. That is, for society to invest more in capital, it must consumeless and save more of its current income. The growth that arises from capital accu-mulation is not a free lunch: It requires that society sacrifice consumption of goodsand services in the present in order to enjoy higher consumption in the future.TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS LEADS TO\\nNEW PRODUCTS , SUCH AS THIS HYBRID\\nELECTRIC /GAS-POWERED CAR , THAT\\nREDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ONNONRENEWABLE RESOURCES\\n.\\n250 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nThe next chapter examines in more detail how the economy’s financial mar-\\nkets coordinate saving and investment. It also examines how government policiesinfluence the amount of saving and investment that takes place. At this point it isimportant to note that encouraging saving and investment is one way that a gov-ernment can encourage growth and, in the long run, raise the economy’s standardof living.\\nTo see the importance of investment for economic growth, consider Figure\\n12-1, which displays data on 15 countries. Panel (a) shows each country’s growthrate over a 31-year period. The countries are ordered by their growth rates, frommost to least rapid. Panel (b) shows the percentage of GDP that each countrydevotes to investment. The correlation between growth and investment, althoughnot perfect, is strong. Countries that devote a large share of GDP to investment,such as Singapore and Japan, tend to have high growth rates. Countries thatdevote a small share of GDP to investment, such as Rwanda and Bangladesh, tendto have low growth rates. Studies that examine a more comprehensive list of coun-tries confirm this strong correlation between investment and growth.\\nThere is, however, a problem in interpreting these data. As the appendix\\nto Chapter 2 discussed, a correlation between two variables does not establishwhich variable is the cause and which is the effect. It is possible that high invest-ment causes high growth, but it is also possible that high growth causes high\\n(a) Growth Rate 1960–1991 (b) Investment 1960–1991\\nSouth Korea\\nSingapore\\nJapan\\nIsrael\\nCanada\\nBrazil\\nWest Germany\\nMexico\\nUnited Kingdom\\nNigeria\\nUnited States\\nIndia\\nBangladesh\\nChile\\nRwandaSouth Korea\\nSingapore\\nJapan\\nIsrael\\nCanada\\nBrazil\\nWest Germany\\nMexico\\nUnited Kingdom\\nNigeria\\nUnited States\\nIndia\\nBangladesh\\nChile\\nRwanda\\nInvestment (percent of GDP) Growth Rate (percent)01234567 0 1 02 03 04 0\\nFigure 12-1GROWTH AND INVESTMENT . Panel (a) shows the growth rate of GDP per person for\\n15 countries over the period from 1960 to 1991. Panel (b) shows the percentage of GDPthat each country devoted to investment over this period. The figure shows that\\ninvestment and growth are positively correlated.CHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 251\\ninvestment. (Or, perhaps, high growth and high investment are both caused by a\\nthird variable that has been omitted from the analysis.) The data by themselvescannot tell us the direction of causation. Nonetheless, because capital accumula-tion affects productivity so clearly and directly, many economists interpret thesedata as showing that high investment leads to more rapid economic growth.\\nDIMINISHING RETURNS AND THE CATCH-UP EFFECT\\nSuppose that a government, convinced by the evidence in Figure 12-1, pursuespolicies that raise the nation’s saving rate—the percentage of GDP devoted tosaving rather than consumption. What happens? With the nation saving more,fewer resources are needed to make consumption goods, and more resources areavailable to make capital goods. As a result, the capital stock increases, leading torising productivity and more rapid growth in GDP . But how long does this higherrate of growth last? Assuming that the saving rate remains at its new higher level,does the growth rate of GDP stay high indefinitely or only for a period of time?\\nThe traditional view of the production process is that capital is subject to\\ndiminishing returns: As the stock of capital rises, the extra output produced from\\nan additional unit of capital falls. In other words, when workers already have alarge quantity of capital to use in producing goods and services, giving them anadditional unit of capital increases their productivity only slightly. Because ofdiminishing returns, an increase in the saving rate leads to higher growth only fora while. As the higher saving rate allows more capital to be accumulated, the ben-efits from additional capital become smaller over time, and so growth slows down.In the long run, the higher saving rate leads to a higher level of productivity and income,but not to higher growth in these variables. Reaching this long run, however, can take\\nquite a while. According to studies of international data on economic growth,increasing the saving rate can lead to substantially higher growth for a period ofseveral decades.\\nThe diminishing returns to capital has another important implication: Other\\nthings equal, it is easier for a country to grow fast if it starts out relatively poor.This effect of initial conditions on subsequent growth is sometimes called thecatch-up effect. In poor countries, workers lack even the most rudimentary tools\\nand, as a result, have low productivity. Small amounts of capital investment wouldsubstantially raise these workers’ productivity. By contrast, workers in rich coun-tries have large amounts of capital with which to work, and this partly explainstheir high productivity. Yet with the amount of capital per worker already so high,additional capital investment has a relatively small effect on productivity. Studiesof international data on economic growth confirm this catch-up effect: Controllingfor other variables, such as the percentage of GDP devoted to investment, poorcountries do tend to grow faster than rich countries.\\nThis catch-up effect can help explain some of the puzzling results in Figure 12-1.\\nOver this 31-year period, the United States and South Korea devoted a similarshare of GDP to investment. Yet the United States experienced only mediocregrowth of about 2 percent, while Korea experienced spectacular growth of morethan 6 percent. The explanation is the catch-up effect. In 1960, Korea had GDP perperson less than one-tenth the U.S. level, in part because previous investment hadbeen so low. With a small initial capital stock, the benefits to capital accumulationwere much greater in Korea, and this gave Korea a higher subsequent growth rate.diminishing returns\\nthe property whereby the benefitfrom an extra unit of an inputdeclines as the quantity of theinput increases\\ncatch-up effect\\nthe property whereby countriesthat start off poor tend to growmore rapidly than countriesthat start off rich252 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nThis catch-up effect shows up in other aspects of life. When a school gives an\\nend-of-year award to the “Most Improved” student, that student is usually onewho began the year with relatively poor performance. Students who began theyear not studying find improvement easier than students who always workedhard. Note that it is good to be “Most Improved,” given the starting point, but it iseven better to be “Best Student.” Similarly, economic growth over the last severaldecades has been much more rapid in South Korea than in the United States, butGDP per person is still higher in the United States.\\nINVESTMENT FROM ABROAD\\nSo far we have discussed how policies aimed at increasing a country’s saving ratecan increase investment and, thereby, long-term economic growth. Yet saving bydomestic residents is not the only way for a country to invest in new capital. Theother way is investment by foreigners.\\nInvestment from abroad takes several forms. Ford Motor Company might\\nbuild a car factory in Mexico. A capital investment that is owned and operated bya foreign entity is called foreign direct investment. Alternatively, an American might\\nbuy stock in a Mexican corporation (that is, buy a share in the ownership of thecorporation); the Mexican corporation can use the proceeds from the stock sale tobuild a new factory. An investment that is financed with foreign money but oper-ated by domestic residents is called foreign portfolio investment. In both cases, Amer-\\nicans provide the resources necessary to increase the stock of capital in Mexico.That is, American saving is being used to finance Mexican investment.\\nWhen foreigners invest in a country, they do so because they expect to earn a\\nreturn on their investment. Ford’s car factory increases the Mexican capital stockand, therefore, increases Mexican productivity and Mexican GDP . Yet Ford takessome of this additional income back to the United States in the form of profit. Sim-ilarly, when an American investor buys Mexican stock, the investor has a right toa portion of the profit that the Mexican corporation earns.\\nInvestment from abroad, therefore, does not have the same effect on all mea-\\nsures of economic prosperity. Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is theincome earned within a country by both residents and nonresidents, whereasgross national product (GNP) is the income earned by residents of a country bothat home and abroad. When Ford opens its car factory in Mexico, some of theincome the factory generates accrues to people who do not live in Mexico. As aresult, foreign investment in Mexico raises the income of Mexicans (measured byGNP) by less than it raises the production in Mexico (measured by GDP).\\nNonetheless, investment from abroad is one way for a country to grow. Even\\nthough some of the benefits from this investment flow back to the foreign owners,this investment does increase the economy’s stock of capital, leading to higher pro-ductivity and higher wages. Moreover, investment from abroad is one way forpoor countries to learn the state-of-the-art technologies developed and used inricher countries. For these reasons, many economists who advise governments inless developed economies advocate policies that encourage investment fromabroad. Often this means removing restrictions that governments have imposedon foreign ownership of domestic capital.\\nAn organization that tries to encourage the flow of investment to poor coun-\\ntries is the World Bank. This international organization obtains funds from theCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 253\\nworld’s advanced countries, such as the United States, and uses these resources to\\nmake loans to less developed countries so that they can invest in roads, sewer sys-tems, schools, and other types of capital. It also offers the countries advice abouthow the funds might best be used. The World Bank, together with its sister orga-nization, the International Monetary Fund, was set up after World War II. One les-son from the war was that economic distress often leads to political turmoil,international tensions, and military conflict. Thus, every country has an interest inpromoting economic prosperity around the world. The World Bank and the Inter-national Monetary Fund are aimed at achieving that common goal.\\nEDUCATION\\nEducation—investment in human capital—is at least as important as investmentin physical capital for a country’s long-run economic success. In the United States,each year of schooling raises a person’s wage on average by about 10 percent. Inless developed countries, where human capital is especially scarce, the gapbetween the wages of educated and uneducated workers is even larger. Thus, oneway in which government policy can enhance the standard of living is to providegood schools and to encourage the population to take advantage of them.\\nInvestment in human capital, like investment in physical capital, has an\\nopportunity cost. When students are in school, they forgo the wages they couldhave earned. In less developed countries, children often drop out of school at anearly age, even though the benefit of additional schooling is very high, simplybecause their labor is needed to help support the family.\\nSome economists have argued that human capital is particularly important for\\neconomic growth because human capital conveys positive externalities. An exter-\\nnality is the effect of one person’s actions on the well-being of a bystander. An edu-\\ncated person, for instance, might generate new ideas about how best to producegoods and services. If these ideas enter society’s pool of knowledge, so everyonecan use them, then the ideas are an external benefit of education. In this case, thereturn to schooling for society is even greater than the return for the individual.This argument would justify the large subsidies to human-capital investment thatwe observe in the form of public education.\\nOne problem facing some poor countries is the brain drain —the emigration of\\nmany of the most highly educated workers to rich countries, where these workerscan enjoy a higher standard of living. If human capital does have positive exter-nalities, then this brain drain makes those people left behind poorer than they oth-erwise would be. This problem offers policymakers a dilemma. On the one hand,the United States and other rich countries have the best systems of higher educa-tion, and it would seem natural for poor countries to send their best studentsabroad to earn higher degrees. On the other hand, those students who have spenttime abroad may choose not to return home, and this brain drain will reduce thepoor nation’s stock of human capital even further.\\nPROPERTY RIGHTS AND POLITICAL STABILITY\\nAnother way in which policymakers can foster economic growth is by protectingproperty rights and promoting political stability. As we first noted when we254 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\ndiscussed economic interdependence in Chapter 3, production in market\\neconomies arises from the interactions of millions of individuals and firms. Whenyou buy a car, for instance, you are buying the output of a car dealer, a car manu-facturer, a steel company, an iron ore mining company, and so on. This division ofproduction among many firms allows the economy’s factors of production to beused as effectively as possible. To achieve this outcome, the economy has to coor-dinate transactions among these firms, as well as between firms and consumers.Market economies achieve this coordination through market prices. That is, mar-ket prices are the instrument with which the invisible hand of the marketplacebrings supply and demand into balance.\\nAn important prerequisite for the price system to work is an economy-wide\\nrespect for property rights. Property rights refer to the ability of people to exercise\\nauthority over the resources they own. A mining company will not make the effortto mine iron ore if it expects the ore to be stolen. The company mines the ore onlyif it is confident that it will benefit from the ore’s subsequent sale. For this reason,courts serve an important role in a market economy: They enforce property rights.Through the criminal justice system, the courts discourage direct theft. In addition,through the civil justice system, the courts ensure that buyers and sellers live up totheir contracts.\\nAlthough those of us in developed countries tend to take property rights for\\ngranted, those living in less developed countries understand that lack of propertyrights can be a major problem. In many countries, the system of justice does notwork well. Contracts are hard to enforce, and fraud often goes unpunished.In more extreme cases, the government not only fails to enforce property rightsbut actually infringes upon them. To do business in some countries, firms areexpected to bribe powerful government officials. Such corruption impedes thecoordinating power of markets. It also discourages domestic saving and invest-ment from abroad.\\nOne threat to property rights is political instability. When revolutions and\\ncoups are common, there is doubt about whether property rights will be respectedin the future. If a revolutionary government might confiscate the capital of somebusinesses, as was often true after communist revolutions, domestic residents haveless incentive to save, invest, and start new businesses. At the same time, foreign-ers have less incentive to invest in the country. Even the threat of revolution can actto depress a nation’s standard of living.\\nThus, economic prosperity depends in part on political prosperity. A country\\nwith an efficient court system, honest government officials, and a stable constitu-tion will enjoy a higher economic standard of living than a country with a poorcourt system, corrupt officials, and frequent revolutions and coups.\\nFREE TRADE\\nSome of the world’s poorest countries have tried to achieve more rapid economicgrowth by pursuing inward-oriented policies. These policies are aimed at raising pro-\\nductivity and living standards within the country by avoiding interaction with therest of the world. As we discussed in Chapter 9, domestic firms sometimes claimthey need protection from foreign competition in order to compete and grow. Thisinfant-industry argument, together with a general distrust of foreigners, has atCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 255\\ntimes led policymakers in less developed countries to impose tariffs and other\\ntrade restrictions.\\nMost economists today believe that poor countries are better off pursuing\\noutward-oriented policies that integrate these countries into the world economy.\\nChapters 3 and 9 showed how international trade can improve the economic well-being of a country’s citizens. Trade is, in some ways, a type of technology. When acountry exports wheat and imports steel, the country benefits in the same way asif it had invented a technology for turning wheat into steel. A country that elimi-nates trade restrictions will, therefore, experience the same kind of economicgrowth that would occur after a major technological advance.\\nThe adverse impact of inward orientation becomes clear when one considers\\nthe small size of many less developed economies. The total GDP of Argentina,for instance, is about that of Philadelphia. Imagine what would happen if thePhiladelphia City Council were to prohibit city residents from trading with peopleliving outside the city limits. Without being able to take advantage of the gainsfrom trade, Philadelphia would need to produce all the goods it consumes.It would also have to produce all its own capital goods, rather than importingstate-of-the-art equipment from other cities. Living standards in Philadelphiawould fall immediately, and the problem would likely only get worse over time.This is precisely what happened when Argentina pursued inward-oriented poli-cies throughout much of the twentieth century. By contrast, countries pursuingoutward-oriented policies, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, haveenjoyed high rates of economic growth.\\nThe amount that a nation trades with others is determined not only by gov-\\nernment policy but also by geography. Countries with good natural seaports findtrade easier than countries without this resource. It is not a coincidence that manyof the world’s major cities, such as New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong, arelocated next to oceans. Similarly, because landlocked countries find internationaltrade more difficult, they tend to have lower levels of income than countries witheasy access to the world’s waterways.\\nTHE CONTROL OF POPULATION GROWTH\\nA country’s productivity and living standard are determined in part by its popu-lation growth. Obviously, population is a key determinant of a country’s laborforce. It is no surprise, therefore, that countries with large populations (such as theUnited States and Japan) tend to produce greater GDP than countries with smallpopulations (such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands). But total GDP is not a\\ngood measure of economic well-being. For policymakers concerned about livingstandards, GDP per person is more important, for it tells us the quantity of goods\\nand services available for the typical individual in the economy.\\nHow does growth in the number of people affect the amount of GDP per per-\\nson? Standard theories of economic growth predict that high population growthreduces GDP per person. The reason is that rapid growth in the number of work-ers forces the other factors of production to be spread more thinly. In particular,when population growth is rapid, equipping each worker with a large quantity ofcapital is more difficult. A smaller quantity of capital per worker leads to lowerproductivity and lower GDP per worker.256 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nThis problem is most apparent in the case of human capital. Countries with\\nhigh population growth have large numbers of school-age children. This placesa larger burden on the educational system. It is not surprising, therefore, that educational attainment tends to be low in countries with high population growth.\\nThe differences in population growth around the world are large. In devel-\\noped countries, such as the United States and western Europe, the population hasrisen about 1 percent per year in recent decades, and it is expected to rise evenmore slowly in the future. By contrast, in many poor African countries, populationgrowth is about 3 percent per year. At this rate, the population doubles every23 years.\\nReducing the rate of population growth is widely thought to be one way less\\ndeveloped countries can try to raise their standards of living. In some countries,this goal is accomplished directly with laws regulating the number of childrenfamilies may have. China, for instance, allows only one child per family; coupleswho violate this rule are subject to substantial fines. In countries with greater\\nYou may have heard economics\\ncalled “the dismal science.”The field was pinned with thislabel many years ago be-cause of a theory proposedby Thomas Robert Malthus(1766–1834), an English min-ister and early economicthinker. In a famous bookcalled An Essay on the Princi-\\nple of Population as It Affectsthe Future Improvement ofSociety, Malthus offered what\\nmay be history’s most chilling forecast. Malthus argued thatan ever increasing population would continually strain soci-ety’s ability to provide for itself. As a result, mankind wasdoomed to forever live in poverty.\\nMalthus’s logic was very simple. He began by noting\\nthat “food is necessary to the existence of man” and that“the passion between the sexes is necessary and willremain nearly in its present state.” He concluded that “the\\npower of population is infinitely greater than the power in theearth to produce subsistence for man.” According toMalthus, the only check on population growth was “miseryand vice.” Attempts by charities or governments to alleviatepoverty were counterproductive, he argued, because theymerely allowed the poor to have more children, placing evengreater strains on society’s productive capabilities.\\nFortunately, Malthus’s dire forecast was far off the\\nmark. Although the world population has increased aboutsixfold over the past two centuries, living standards aroundthe world are on average much\\nhigher. As a result of economicgrowth, chronic hunger and malnu-trition are less common now thanthey were in Malthus’s day.Famines occur from time to time,but they are more often the resultof an unequal income distributionor political instability than an inad-equate production of food.\\nWhere did Malthus go wrong?\\nHe failed to appreciate that growthin mankind’s ingenuity wouldexceed growth in population. Newideas about how to produce and even the kinds of goods toproduce have led to greater prosperity than Malthus—oranyone else of his era—ever imagined. Pesticides, fertiliz-ers, mechanized farm equipment, and new crop varietieshave allowed each farmer to feed ever greater numbers ofpeople. The wealth-enhancing effects of technologicalprogress have exceeded whatever wealth-diminishingeffects might be attributed to population growth.\\nIndeed, some economists now go so far as to suggest\\nthat population growth may even have helped mankindachieve higher standards of living. If there are more people,then there are more scientists, inventors, and engineers tocontribute to technological progress, which benefits every-one. Perhaps world population growth, rather than being asource of economic deprivation as Malthus predicted, hasactually been an engine of technological progress and eco-nomic prosperity.\\nTHOMAS MALTHUS\\nFYI\\nThomas\\nMalthus on\\nPopulation\\nGrowthCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 257\\nCASE STUDY THE PRODUCTIVITY SLOWDOWN\\nFrom 1959 to 1973, productivity, as measured by output per hour worked in\\nU.S. businesses, grew at a rate of 3.2 percent per year. From 1973 to 1998, pro-ductivity grew by only 1.3 percent per year. Not surprisingly, this slowdown inproductivity growth has been reflected in reduced growth in real wages andfamily incomes. It is also reflected in a general sense of economic anxiety.freedom, the goal of reduced population growth is accomplished less directly byincreasing awareness of birth control techniques.\\nThe final way in which a country can influence population growth is to apply\\none of the Ten Principles of Economics: People respond to incentives. Bearing a child,\\nlike any decision, has an opportunity cost. When the opportunity cost rises, peoplewill choose to have smaller families. In particular, women with the opportunity toreceive good education and desirable employment tend to want fewer childrenthan those with fewer opportunities outside the home. Hence, policies that fosterequal treatment of women are one way for less developed economies to reduce therate of population growth.\\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\\nThe primary reason that living standards are higher today than they were a cen-tury ago is that technological knowledge has advanced. The telephone, the tran-sistor, the computer, and the internal combustion engine are among the thousandsof innovations that have improved the ability to produce goods and services.\\nAlthough most technological advance comes from private research by firms\\nand individual inventors, there is also a public interest in promoting these efforts.To a large extent, knowledge is a public good: Once one person discovers an idea,\\nthe idea enters society’s pool of knowledge, and other people can freely use it. Justas government has a role in providing a public good such as national defense, italso has a role in encouraging the research and development of new technologies.\\nThe U.S. government has long played a role in the creation and dissemination\\nof technological knowledge. A century ago, the government sponsored researchabout farming methods and advised farmers how best to use their land. Morerecently, the U.S. government has, through the Air Force and NASA, supportedaerospace research; as a result, the United States is a leading maker of rockets andplanes. The government continues to encourage advances in knowledge withresearch grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutesof Health and with tax breaks for firms engaging in research and development.\\nYet another way in which government policy encourages research is through\\nthe patent system. When a person or firm invents a new product, such as a newdrug, the inventor can apply for a patent. If the product is deemed truly original,the government awards the patent, which gives the inventor the exclusive right tomake the product for a specified number of years. In essence, the patent gives theinventor a property right over his invention, turning his new idea from a publicgood into a private good. By allowing inventors to profit from their inventions—even if only temporarily—the patent system enhances the incentive for individu-als and firms to engage in research.\\n258 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nBecause it has accumulated over so many years, this fall in productivity growth\\nof 1.9 percentage points has had a large effect on incomes. If this slowdown hadnot occurred, the income of the average American would today be about 60 per-cent higher.\\nThe slowdown in economic growth has been one of the most important\\nproblems facing economic policymakers. Economists are often asked whatcaused the slowdown and what can be done to reverse it. Unfortunately, despitemuch research on these questions, the answers remain elusive.\\nTwo facts are well established. First, the slowdown in productivity growth\\nis a worldwide phenomenon. Sometime in the mid-1970s, economic growthslowed not only in the United States but also in other industrial countries,including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom.Although some of these countries have had more rapid growth than the UnitedStates, all of them have had slow growth compared to their own past experi-ence. To explain the slowdown in U.S. growth, therefore, it seems necessary tolook beyond our borders.\\nSecond, the slowdown cannot be traced to those factors of production that\\nare most easily measured. Economists can measure directly the quantity ofphysical capital that workers have available. They can also measure human cap-ital in the form of years of schooling. It appears that the slowdown in produc-tivity is not primarily attributable to reduced growth in these inputs.\\nTechnology appears to be one of the few remaining culprits. That is, having\\nruled out most other explanations, many economists attribute the slowdown ineconomic growth to a slowdown in the creation of new ideas about how to pro-duce goods and services. Because the quantity of “ideas” is hard to measure,this explanation is difficult to confirm or refute.\\nIn some ways, it is odd to say that the last 25 years have been a period of\\nslow technological progress. This period has witnessed the spread of computersacross the economy—an historic technological revolution that has affectedalmost every industry and almost every firm. Yet, for some reason, this changehas not yet been reflected in more rapid economic growth. As economist RobertSolow put it, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivitystatistics.”\\nWhat does the future of economic growth hold? An optimistic scenario is\\nthat the computer revolution will rejuvenate economic growth once these newmachines are integrated into the economy and their potential is fully under-stood. Economic historians note that the discovery of electricity took manydecades to have a large impact on productivity and living standards becausepeople had to figure out the best ways to use the new resource. Perhaps thecomputer revolution will have a similar delayed effect. Some observers believethis may be starting to happen already, for productivity growth did pick up a bitin the late 1990s. It is still too early to say, however, whether this change willpersist.\\nA more pessimistic scenario is that, after a period of rapid scientific and\\ntechnological advance, we have entered a new phase of slower growth inknowledge, productivity, and incomes. Data from a longer span of history seemto support this conclusion. Figure 12-2 shows the average growth of real GDPper person in the developed world going back to 1870. The productivity slow-down is apparent in the last two entries: Around 1970, the growth rate slowedfrom 3.7 to 2.2 percent. But compared to earlier periods of history, the anomalyCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 259\\nis not the slow growth of recent years but rather the rapid growth during the\\n1950s and 1960s. Perhaps the decades after World War II were a period ofunusually rapid technological advance, and growth has slowed down simplybecause technological progress has returned to a more normal rate.Growth Rate\\n(percent\\nper year)\\n1.01.52.02.53.03.54.0\\n1870–\\n18901890–\\n19101910–\\n19301930–\\n19501950–\\n19701970–\\n19900Figure 12-2\\nTHEGROWTH IN REAL GDP\\nPERPERSON .

The priest recommendsprayer, but the chickens continue todie. The priest then recommends musicfor the chicken coop, but the deathscontinue unabated. Pondering again,the priest recommends repainting thechicken coop in bright colors. Finally, allthe chickens die. “What a shame,” thepriest tells the peasant. “I had so manymore good ideas.”Since independence, African coun-\\ntries have looked to donor nations—often their former colonial rulers—and tothe international finance institutions forguidance on growth. Indeed, since theonset of the African debt crises of the1980s, the guidance has become a kindof economic receivership, with the poli-cies of many African nations decided in aseemingly endless cycle of meetingswith the IMF, the World Bank, donors,and creditors.\\nWhat a shame. So many good\\nideas, so few results. Output per headfell 0.7 percent between 1978 and 1987,and 0.6 percent during 1987–1994.Some growth is estimated for 1995 butonly at 0.6 percent—far below the faster-growing developing countries. . . .\\nThe IMF and World Bank would be\\nabsolved of shared responsibility forslow growth if Africa were structurallyincapable of growth rates seen in otherparts of the world or if the continent’slow growth were an impenetrable mys-tery. But Africa’s growth rates arenot huge mysteries. The evidence on cross-country growth suggests that Africa’s chronically low growth can beexplained by standard economic vari-ables linked to identifiable (and remedi-able) policies. . . .\\nStudies of cross-country growth\\nshow that per capita growth is related to:\\n• the initial income level of the coun-\\ntry, with poorer countries tending togrow faster than richer countries;• the extent of overall market orienta-\\ntion, including openness to trade,domestic market liberalization,private rather than state owner-ship, protection of private propertyrights, and low marginal tax rates;\\n• the national saving rate, which in\\nturn is strongly affected by the gov-ernment’s own saving rate; and\\n• the geographic and resource struc-\\nture of the economy. . . .\\nThese four factors can account\\nbroadly for Africa’s long-term growthpredicament. While it should have grownfaster than other developing areasbecause of relatively low income perhead (and hence larger opportunity for“catch-up” growth), Africa grew moreslowly. This was mainly because of much\\nIN THE NEWS\\nA Solution to\\nAfrica’s Problems\\nCHAPTER 12 PRODUCTION AND GROWTH 261\\nespecially important for technological progress. There is no doubt that these issues\\nare among the most important in economics. The success of one generation’s poli-cymakers in learning and heeding the fundamental lessons about economicgrowth determines what kind of world the next generation will inherit.higher trade barriers; excessive tax\\nrates; lower saving rates; and adversestructural conditions, including an unusu-ally high incidence of inaccessibility tothe sea (15 of 53 countries are land-locked). . . .\\nIf the policies are largely to blame,\\nwhy, then, were they adopted? The his-torical origins of Africa’s antimarket ori-entation are not hard to discern. Afteralmost a century of colonial depreda-tions, African nations understandably iferroneously viewed open trade and for-eign capital as a threat to national sover-eignty. As in Sukarno’s Indonesia,Nehru’s India, and Peron’s Argentina,“self sufficiency” and “state leader-ship,” including state ownership of muchof industry, became the guideposts ofthe economy. As a result, most of Africawent into a largely self-imposed eco-nomic exile. . . .\\nAdam Smith in 1755 famously\\nremarked that “little else is requisite tocarry a state to the highest degrees ofopulence from the lowest barbarism, butpeace, easy taxes, and tolerable admin-istration of justice.” A growth agendaneed not be long and complex. Take hispoints in turn.\\nPeace, of course, is not so easily\\nguaranteed, but the conditions for peaceon the continent are better than today’sghastly headlines would suggest. Sev-eral of the large-scale conflicts that haveravaged the continent are over or nearlyso. . . . The ongoing disasters, such as inLiberia, Rwanda and Somalia, would bebetter contained if the West were willing\\nto provide modest support to African-based peacekeeping efforts.\\n“Easy taxes” are well within the\\nambit of the IMF and World Bank. Buthere, the IMF stands guilty of neglect, ifnot malfeasance. African nations needsimple, low taxes, with modest revenuetargets as a share of GDP. Easy taxesare most essential in international trade,since successful growth will depend,more than anything else, on economicintegration with the rest of the world.Africa’s largely self-imposed exile fromworld markets can end quickly by cuttingimport tariffs and ending export taxes onagricultural exports. Corporate tax ratesshould be cut from rates of 40 percentand higher now prevalent in Africa, torates between 20 percent and 30 per-cent, as in the outward-oriented EastAsian economies. . . .\\nAdam Smith spoke of a “tolerable”\\nadministration of justice, not perfect jus-tice. Market liberalization is the primarykey to strengthening the rule of law. Freetrade, currency convertibility and auto-matic incorporation of business vastlyreduce the scope for official corruptionand allow the government to focus onthe real public goods—internal publicorder, the judicial system, basic pub-lic health and education, and monetarystability. . . .\\nAll of this is possible only if the gov-\\nernment itself has held its own spendingto the necessary minimum. The Asianeconomies show how to function withgovernment spending of 20 percent of\\nGDP or less (China gets by with just 13percent). Education can usefully absorbaround 5 percent of GDP; health, an-other 3 percent; public administration,2 percent; the army and police, 3 per-cent. Government investment spendingcan be held to 5 percent of GDP but onlyif the private sector is invited to pro-vide infrastructure in telecommunica-tions, port facilities, and power. . . .\\nThis fiscal agenda excludes many\\npopular areas for government spending.There is little room for transfers or socialspending beyond education and health(though on my proposals, these wouldget a hefty 8 percent of GDP). Subsidiesto publicly owned companies or market-ing boards should be scrapped. Foodand housing subsidies for urban workerscannot be financed. And, notably, inter-est payments on foreign debt are notbudgeted for. This is because mostbankrupt African states need a freshstart based on deep debt-reduction,which should be implemented in con-junction with far-reaching domesticreforms.\\nSource: Economist, June 29, 1996, pp. 19–21.262 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nN Economic prosperity, as measured by GDP per person,\\nvaries substantially around the world.

Perhaps you are\\nable to pay for them out of your past savings. More likely, however, like most en-trepreneurs, you do not have enough money of your own to finance the start ofyour business. As a result, you have to get the money you need from other sources.SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND\\nTHE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\\n265266 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nThere are various ways for you to finance these capital investments. You could\\nborrow the money, perhaps from a bank or from a friend or relative. In this case,you would promise not only to return the money at a later date but also to pay in-terest for the use of the money. Alternatively, you could convince someone to pro-vide the money you need for your business in exchange for a share of your futureprofits, whatever they might happen to be. In either case, your invest-ment in computers and office equipment is being financed by someone else’s saving.\\nThe financial system consists of those institutions in the economy that help to\\nmatch one person’s saving with another person’s investment. As we discussed inthe previous chapter, saving and investment are key ingredients to long-runeconomic growth: When a country saves a large portion of its GDP , more resourcesare available for investment in capital, and higher capital raises a country’sproductivity and living standard. The previous chapter, however, did not explainhow the economy coordinates saving and investment. At any time, some peoplewant to save some of their income for the future, and others want to borrow in or-der to finance investments in new and growing businesses. What brings thesetwo groups of people together? What ensures that the supply of funds fromthose who want to save balances the demand for funds from those who want to invest?\\nThis chapter examines how the financial system works. First, we discuss the\\nlarge variety of institutions that make up the financial system in our economy. Sec-ond, we discuss the relationship between the financial system and some keymacroeconomic variables—notably saving and investment. Third, we develop amodel of the supply and demand for funds in financial markets. In the model, theinterest rate is the price that adjusts to balance supply and demand. The modelshows how various government policies affect the interest rate and, thereby, soci-ety’s allocation of scarce resources.\\nFINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY\\nAt the broadest level, the financial system moves the economy’s scarce resourcesfrom savers (people who spend less than they earn) to borrowers (people whospend more than they earn). Savers save for various reasons—to put a childthrough college in several years or to retire comfortably in several decades. Simi-larly, borrowers borrow for various reasons—to buy a house in which to live or tostart a business with which to make a living. Savers supply their money to the fi-nancial system with the expectation that they will get it back with interest at a laterdate. Borrowers demand money from the financial system with the knowledgethat they will be required to pay it back with interest at a later date.\\nThe financial system is made up of various financial institutions that help co-\\nordinate savers and borrowers. As a prelude to analyzing the economic forces thatdrive the financial system, let’s discuss the most important of these institutions. Fi-nancial institutions can be grouped into two categories—financial markets and fi-nancial intermediaries. We consider each category in turn.financial system\\nthe group of institutions in theeconomy that help to match oneperson’s saving with anotherperson’s investmentCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 267\\nFINANCIAL MARKETS\\nFinancial markets are the institutions through which a person who wants to save\\ncan directly supply funds to a person who wants to borrow. The two most impor-tant financial markets in our economy are the bond market and the stock market.\\nThe Bond Market When Intel, the giant maker of computer chips, wants to\\nborrow to finance construction of a new factory, it can borrow directly from thepublic. It does this by selling bonds. A bond is a certificate of indebtedness that\\nspecifies the obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond. Put simply, abond is an IOU. It identifies the time at which the loan will be repaid, called thedate of maturity, and the rate of interest that will be paid periodically until the loan\\nmatures. The buyer of a bond gives his or her money to Intel in exchange for thispromise of interest and eventual repayment of the amount borrowed (called theprincipal ). The buyer can hold the bond until maturity or can sell the bond at an\\nearlier date to someone else.\\nThere are literally millions of different bonds in the U.S. economy. When large\\ncorporations, the federal government, or state and local governments need to bor-row to finance the purchase of a new factory, a new jet fighter, or a new school,they usually do so by issuing bonds. If you look at The Wall Street Journal or the\\nbusiness section of your local newspaper, you will find a listing of the prices andinterest rates on some of the most important bond issues. Although these bondsdiffer in many ways, three characteristics of bonds are most important.\\nThe first characteristic is a bond’s term —the length of time until the bond ma-\\ntures. Some bonds have short terms, such as a few months, while others haveterms as long as 30 years. (The British government has even issued a bond thatnever matures, called a perpetuity. This bond pays interest forever, but the princi-\\npal is never repaid.) The interest rate on a bond depends, in part, on its term. Long-term bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because holders of long-term bondshave to wait longer for repayment of principal. If a holder of a long-term bondneeds his money earlier than the distant date of maturity, he has no choice but tosell the bond to someone else, perhaps at a reduced price. To compensate for thisrisk, long-term bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short-term bonds.\\nThe second important characteristic of a bond is its credit risk —the probability\\nthat the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal. Such a failure topay is called a default. Borrowers can (and sometimes do) default on their loans by\\ndeclaring bankruptcy. When bond buyers perceive that the probability of defaultis high, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for this risk. Be-cause the U.S. government is considered a safe credit risk, government bonds tendto pay low interest rates. By contrast, financially shaky corporations raise moneyby issuing junk bonds, which pay very high interest rates. Buyers of bonds can\\njudge credit risk by checking with various private agencies, such as Standard &Poor’s, which rate the credit risk of different bonds.\\nThe third important characteristic of a bond is its tax treatment —the way in\\nwhich the tax laws treat the interest earned on the bond. The interest on mostbonds is taxable income, so that the bond owner has to pay a portion of the inter-est in income taxes. By contrast, when state and local governments issue bonds,called municipal bonds, the bond owners are not required to pay federal income tax\\non the interest income. Because of this tax advantage, bonds issued by state andfinancial markets\\nfinancial institutions throughwhich savers can directlyprovide funds to borrowers\\nbond\\na certificate of indebtedness268 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nlocal governments pay a lower interest rate than bonds issued by corporations or\\nthe federal government.\\nThe Stock Market Another way for Intel to raise funds to build a new\\nsemiconductor factory is to sell stock in the company. Stock represents ownership\\nin a firm and is, therefore, a claim to the profits that the firm makes. For example,if Intel sells a total of 1,000,000 shares of stock, then each share represents owner-ship of 1/1,000,000 of the business.\\nThe sale of stock to raise money is called equity finance, whereas the sale of\\nbonds is called debt finance. Although corporations use both equity and debt fi-\\nnance to raise money for new investments, stocks and bonds are very different.The owner of shares of Intel stock is a part owner of Intel; the owner of an Intelbond is a creditor of the corporation. If Intel is very profitable, the stockholders en-joy the benefits of these profits, whereas the bondholders get only the interest ontheir bonds. And if Intel runs into financial difficulty, the bondholders are paidwhat they are due before stockholders receive anything at all. Compared to bonds,stocks offer the holder both higher risk and potentially higher return.\\nAfter a corporation issues stock by selling shares to the public, these shares\\ntrade among stockholders on organized stock exchanges. In these transactions, thecorporation itself receives no money when its stock changes hands. The most im-portant stock exchanges in the U.S. economy are the New York Stock Exchange,the American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ (National Association of SecuritiesDealers Automated Quotation system). Most of the world’s countries have theirown stock exchanges on which the shares of local companies trade.\\nThe prices at which shares trade on stock exchanges are determined by the\\nsupply and demand for the stock in these companies. Because stock representsownership in a corporation, the demand for a stock (and thus its price) reflectspeople’s perception of the corporation’s future profitability. When people becomeoptimistic about a company’s future, they raise their demand for its stock andthereby bid up the price of a share of stock. Conversely, when people come to ex-pect a company to have little profit or even losses, the price of a share falls.\\nVarious stock indexes are available to monitor the overall level of stock prices.\\nAstock index is computed as an average of a group of stock prices. The most fa-\\nmous stock index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has been computedregularly since 1896. It is now based on the prices of the stocks of 30 major U.S.companies, such as General Motors, General Electric, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, AT&T,and IBM. Another well-known stock index is the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,which is based on the prices of 500 major companies. Because stock prices reflectexpected profitability, these stock indexes are watched closely as possible indica-tors of future economic conditions.\\nFINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES\\nFinancial intermediaries are financial institutions through which savers can indi-\\nrectly provide funds to borrowers. The term intermediary reflects the role of these\\ninstitutions in standing between savers and borrowers. Here we consider two ofthe most important financial intermediaries—banks and mutual funds.stock\\na claim to partial ownership in a firm\\nTHENEWYORK STOCK EXCHANGE\\nfinancial intermediaries \\nfinancial institutions through whichsavers can indirectly provide fundsto borrowersCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 269\\nBanks\\nIf the owner of a small grocery store wants to finance an expansion of his business,\\nhe probably takes a strategy quite different from Intel.

Here is the\\nkind of information these ta-bles usually provide:\\nNPrice. The single most im-\\nportant piece of informa-tion about a stock is theprice of a share. Thenewspaper usually pre-sents several prices. The\\n“last” or “closing” price is the price of the last trans-action that occurred before the stock exchange closedthe previous day. Many newspapers also give the “high”and “low” prices over the past day of trading and,sometimes, over the past year as well.\\nNVolume. Most newspapers present the number of\\nshares sold during the past day of trading. This figure iscalled the daily volume.\\nNDividend. Corporations pay out some of their profits to\\ntheir stockholders; this amount is called the dividend.\\n(Profits not paid out are called retained earnings and\\nare used by the corporation for additional investment.)Newspapers often report the dividend paid over the pre-vious year for each share of stock. They sometimesreport the dividend yield, which is the dividend ex-\\npressed as a percentage of the stock’s price.\\nNPrice-earnings ratio. A corporation’s earnings, or profit,\\nis the amount of revenue it receives for the sale of itsproducts minus its costs of production as measured byits accountants. Earnings per share is the company’stotal earnings divided by the number of shares of stockoutstanding. Companies use some of their earnings topay dividends to stockholders; the rest is kept in thefirm to make new investments. The price–earningsratio, often called the P/E, is the price of a corpora-tion’s stock divided by the amount the corporationearned per share over the past year. Historically, thetypical price–earnings ratio is about 15. A higher P/E in-dicates that a corporation’s stock is expensive relativeto its recent earnings; this might indicate either thatpeople expect earnings to rise in the future or that thestock is overvalued. Conversely, a lower P/E indicatesthat a corporation’s stock is cheap relative to its recentearnings; this might indicate either that people expectearnings to fall or that the stock is undervalued.\\nWhy does the newspaper report all these data every day?\\nMany people who invest their savings in stock follow thesenumbers closely when deciding which stocks to buy and sell.By contrast, other stockholders follow a buy-and-hold strat-egy: They buy the stock of well-run companies, hold it forlong periods of time, and do not respond to the daily fluctu-ations reported in the paper.\\nName of\\ncompanySymbol for\\ncompany’s stock\\n52 Weeks\\nHi Lo Stock Sym DivYld\\n% PEVol\\n100s Hi Lo CloseNet\\nChg\\n263/16\\n127/8\\n757/16\\n221/2237/16\\n67/8\\n475/16\\n93/4CslFnl\\nCoastcastCocaColaCCFemsa ADRTOPrS\\nPAR\\nKO\\nKOF2.09\\n.64\\n.12e8.6\\n...\\n1.3\\n.9...\\n1740\\n...59\\n171\\n39384\\n212124\\n1/4\\n113/8\\n51    \\n1313/162313/16\\n107/8\\n493/4\\n127/8241/4\\n113/8\\n51    \\n133/4+1/16\\n+3/8\\n+11/16\\n+1/16Dividend\\namountDividend\\nyield\\nPrice–\\nearnings\\nratioTrading volume over\\nthe previous day\\nHighest and\\nlowest price over\\nthe previous dayLast price at which\\nthe stock traded\\nChange in\\nclosing price\\nfrom the\\nday beforeHighest and lowest\\nprice of the stock\\nover the past year\\nFYI\\nHow to Read\\nthe Newspaper’s\\nStock Tables270 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nwould find it difficult to raise funds in the bond and stock markets. Most buyers of\\nstocks and bonds prefer to buy those issued by larger, more familiar companies.The small grocer, therefore, most likely finances his business expansion with a loanfrom a local bank.\\nBanks are the financial intermediaries with which people are most familiar. A\\nprimary job of banks is to take in deposits from people who want to save and usethese deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow. Banks pay depositorsinterest on their deposits and charge borrowers slightly higher interest on theirloans. The difference between these rates of interest covers the banks’ costs and re-turns some profit to the owners of the banks.\\nBesides being financial intermediaries, banks play a second important role in\\nthe economy: They facilitate purchases of goods and services by allowing peopleto write checks against their deposits. In other words, banks help create a specialasset that people can use as a medium of exchange. A medium of exchange is an item\\nthat people can easily use to engage in transactions. A bank’s role in providing amedium of exchange distinguishes it from many other financial institutions.Stocks and bonds, like bank deposits, are a possible store of value for the wealth that\\npeople have accumulated in past saving, but access to this wealth is not as easy,cheap, and immediate as just writing a check. For now, we ignore this secondrole of banks, but we will return to it when we discuss the monetary system inChapter 15.\\nMutual Funds A financial intermediary of increasing importance in the U.S.\\neconomy is the mutual fund. A mutual fund is an institution that sells shares to\\nthe public and uses the proceeds to buy a selection, or portfolio, of various types of\\nstocks, bonds, or both stocks and bonds. The shareholder of the mutual fund ac-cepts all the risk and return associated with the portfolio. If the value of the port-folio rises, the shareholder benefits; if the value of the portfolio falls, theshareholder suffers the loss.\\nThe primary advantage of mutual funds is that they allow people with small\\namounts of money to diversify. Buyers of stocks and bonds are well advised toheed the adage: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Because the value of anysingle stock or bond is tied to the fortunes of one company, holding a single kindof stock or bond is very risky. By contrast, people who hold a diverse portfolio ofstocks and bonds face less risk because they have only a small stake in each com-pany. Mutual funds make this diversification easy. With only a few hundred dol-lars, a person can buy shares in a mutual fund and, indirectly, become the partowner or creditor of hundreds of major companies. For this service, the company\\nmutual fund\\nan institution that sells sharesto the public and uses the proceedsto buy a portfolio of stocks and bondsCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 271\\noperating the mutual fund charges shareholders a fee, usually between 0.5 and 2.0\\npercent of assets each year.\\nA second advantage claimed by mutual fund companies is that mutual funds\\ngive ordinary people access to the skills of professional money managers. Themanagers of most mutual funds pay close attention to the developments andprospects of the companies in which they buy stock. These managers buy the stockof those companies that they view as having a profitable future and sell the stockof companies with less promising prospects. This professional management, it isargued, should increase the return that mutual fund depositors earn on their sav-ings.\\nFinancial economists, however, are often skeptical of this second argument.\\nWith thousands of money managers paying close attention to each company’sprospects, the price of a company’s stock is usually a good reflection of the com-pany’s true value. As a result, it is hard to “beat the market” by buying good stocksand selling bad ones. In fact, mutual funds called index funds, which buy all the\\nstocks in a given stock index, perform somewhat better on average than mutualfunds that take advantage of active management by professional money man-agers. The explanation for the superior performance of index funds is that theykeep costs low by buying and selling very rarely and by not having to pay thesalaries of the professional money managers.\\nSUMMING UP\\nThe U.S. economy contains a large variety of financial institutions. In addition tothe bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds, there are also pen-sion funds, credit unions, insurance companies, and even the local loan shark.These institutions differ in many ways. When analyzing the macroeconomic roleof the financial system, however, it is more important to keep in mind the similar-ity of these institutions than the differences. These financial institutions all servethe same goal—directing the resources of savers into the hands of borrowers.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What is stock? What is a bond? How are they different?\\nHow are they similar?\\nSAVING AND INVESTMENT\\nIN THE NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS\\nEvents that occur within the financial system are central to understanding devel-\\nopments in the overall economy. As we have just seen, the institutions that makeup this system—the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds—have the role of coordinating the economy’s saving and investment. And as wesaw in the previous chapter, saving and investment are important determinants oflong-run growth in GDP and living standards. As a result, macroeconomists needto understand how financial markets work and how various events and policiesaffect them.272 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nAs a starting point for an analysis of financial markets, we discuss in this sec-\\ntion the key macroeconomic variables that measure activity in these markets. Ouremphasis here is not on behavior but on accounting. Accounting refers to how var-\\nious numbers are defined and added up. A personal accountant might help an in-dividual add up his income and expenses. A national income accountant does thesame thing for the economy as a whole. The national income accounts include, inparticular, GDP and the many related statistics.\\nThe rules of national income accounting include several important identities.\\nRecall that an identity is an equation that must be true because of the way the vari-\\nables in the equation are defined. Identities are useful to keep in mind, for theyclarify how different variables are related to one another. Here we consider someaccounting identities that shed light on the macroeconomic role of financialmarkets.\\nSOME IMPORTANT IDENTITIES\\nRecall that gross domestic product (GDP) is both total income in an economyand the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services. GDPTHEU.S. STOCK MARKET EXPERIENCED A\\nquadrupling of stock prices during the\\n1990s. The following article tries to ex-plain this remarkable boom. It suggeststhat people bid up stock prices becausethey came to view stocks as less riskythan they previously thought.\\nAre Stocks Overvalued?\\nNot a Chance\\nBYJAMES K. G LASSMAN\\nANDKEVINA. H ASSETT\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average has\\nreturned more than 200 percent overthe past five years, and the past three\\nhave set an all-time record. So it’shardly surprising that many observersworry the stock market is overvalued.One of the most popular measures ofvaluation, the ratio of a stock’s price toits earnings per share, P/E, is close toan all-time high. The P/E of the averagestock on the Dow is 22.5, meaning thatit costs $22.50 to buy $1 in profits—or,conversely, that an investor’s return(earnings divided by price) is just 4.4percent, vs. 5.9 percent for long-termTreasury bonds.\\nYet Warren Buffett, chairman of\\nBerkshire Hathaway Corp. and themost successful large-scale investor ofour time, told shareholders in a March14 letter that “there is no reason tothink of stocks as generally overval-ued” as long as interest rates remainlow and businesses continue to oper-ate as profitably as they have in recentyears. Investors were buoyed by thisstatement, even though Mr. Buffettprovided no analysis to back up his as-sertion.Mr. Buffett is right—and we have\\nthe numbers and the theory to back himup. Worries about overvaluation, we be-lieve, are based on a serious and wide-spread misunderstanding of the returnsand risks associated with equities. Weare not so foolish as to predict the short-term course of stocks, but we are not re-luctant to state that, based on modestassumptions about interest rates andprofit levels, current P/E levels give usno great concern—nor would levels asmuch as twice as high.\\nThe fact is that if you hold stocks in-\\nstead of bonds the amount of moneyflowing into your pockets will be higherover time. Why? Both bonds and stocksprovide their owners with a flow of cashover time. For bonds, the arithmetic issimple: If you buy a $10,000 bond paying6 percent interest today, you’ll receive$600 every year. For equities, the mathis more complicated: Assume that astock currently yields 2 percent, or $2for each share priced at $100. Say youown 100 shares; total dividend paymentsare $200—much lower than for bonds.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nThe Stock Market Boom\\nof the 1990sCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 273\\n(denoted as Y) is divided into four components of expenditure: consumption ( C),\\ninvestment ( I), government purchases ( G), and net exports ( NX). We write\\nY/H11005C/H11001I/H11001G/H11001NX.\\nThis equation is an identity because every dollar of expenditure that shows up on\\nthe left-hand side also shows up in one of the four components on the right-handside. Because of the way each of the variables is defined and measured, this equa-tion must always hold.\\nIn this chapter, we simplify our analysis by assuming that the economy we are\\nexamining is closed. A closed economy is one that does not interact with other\\neconomies. In particular, a closed economy does not engage in international tradein goods and services, nor does it engage in international borrowing and lending.Of course, actual economies are open economies —that is, they interact with other\\neconomies around the world. (We will examine the macroeconomics of openeconomies later in this book.) Nonetheless, assuming a closed economy is a usefulsimplification by which we can learn some lessons that apply to all economies.Moreover, this assumption applies perfectly to the world economy (inasmuch asinterplanetary trade is not yet common).But wait. There is a big difference.\\nProfits grow over time. If that dividendshould increase with profits, say at arate of 5 percent annually, then, by the30th year, your annual dividend paymentwill be over $800, or one-third more thanthe bond is yielding. The price of thestock almost certainly will have risenas well.\\nBy this simple exercise, we can see\\nthat stocks—even with their profitsgrowing at a moderate 5 percent—willreturn far more than bonds over long pe-riods. Over the past 70 years, stockshave annually returned 4.8 percent-age points more than long-term U.S.Treasury bonds and 6.8 points morethan Treasury bills, according to Ibbot-son Associates Inc., a Chicago researchfirm.\\nBut isn’t that extra reward—what\\neconomists call the “equity premium”—merely the bonus paid by the market toinvestors who accept higher risk, sincereturns for stocks are so much more un-certain than for bonds? To this question,we respond: What extra risk?In his book “Stocks for the Long\\nRun,” Jeremy J. Siegel of the Universityof Pennsylvania concludes: “It is widelyknown that stock returns, on average,exceed bonds in the long run. But it is lit-tle known that in the long run, the risks instocks are less than those found inbonds or even bills!” Mr. Siegel lookedat every 20-year holding period from1802 to 1992 and found that the worstreal return for stocks was an annual av-erage of 1.2 percent and the best wasan annual average of 12.6 percent. Forlong-term bonds, the range was \\nminus\\n3.1 percent to plus 8.8 percent; for T-bills, minus 3.0 percent to plus 8.3 per-cent.\\nBased on these findings, it would\\nseem that there should be no need foran equity risk premium at all—and thatthe correct valuation for the stock mar-ket would be one that equalizes thepresent value of cash flow betweenstocks and bonds in the long run. Thinkof the market as offering you two assets,one that will pay you $1,000 over thenext 30 years in a steady stream andanother that, just as surely, will pay you\\nthe $1,000, but the cash flow will varyfrom year to year. Assuming you’re in-vesting for the long term, you will valuethem about the same. . . .\\nAllow us now to suggest a hypothe-\\nsis about the huge returns posted by thestock market over the past few years:As mutual funds have advertised the re-duction of risk acquired by taking thelong view, the risk premium required byshareholders has gradually drifted down.Since Siegel’s results suggest that thecorrect risk premium might be zero, thisdrift downward—and the correspondingtrend toward higher stock prices—maynot be over. . . . In the current environ-ment, we are very comfortable both inholding stocks and in saying that punditswho claim the market is overvalued arefoolish.\\nSource: The Wall Street Journal, Monday, March 30,\\n1998, p. A18.274 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nBecause a closed economy does not engage in international trade, imports and\\nexports are exactly zero. Therefore, net exports ( NX) are also zero. In this case, we\\ncan write\\nY/H11005C/H11001I/H11001G.\\nThis equation states that GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, and gov-\\nernment purchases. Each unit of output sold in a closed economy is consumed, in-vested, or bought by the government.\\nTo see what this identity can tell us about financial markets, subtract Cand G\\nfrom both sides of this equation. We obtain\\nY/H11002 C/H11002 G/H11005I.\\nThe left-hand side of this equation ( Y/H11002 C/H11002 G) is the total income in the economy\\nthat remains after paying for consumption and government purchases: Thisamount is called national saving, or just saving, and is denoted S.Substituting\\nSfor Y/H11002 C/H11002 G,we can write the last equation as\\nS/H11005I.\\nThis equation states that saving equals investment.\\nTo understand the meaning of national saving, it is helpful to manipulate the\\ndefinition a bit more. Let Tdenote the amount that the government collects from\\nhouseholds in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form oftransfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare). We can then write na-tional saving in either of two ways:\\nS/H11005Y/H11002 C/H11002 G\\nor\\nS/H11005(Y/H11002 T/H11002 C) /H11001(T/H11002 G).\\nThese equations are the same, because the two T’s in the second equation cancel\\neach other, but each reveals a different way of thinking about national saving. Inparticular, the second equation separates national saving into two pieces: privatesaving ( Y/H11002 T/H11002 C) and public saving ( T/H11002 G).\\nConsider each of these two pieces. Private saving is the amount of income that\\nhouseholds have left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption. Inparticular, because households receive income of Y,pay taxes of T,and spend Con\\nconsumption, private saving is Y/H11002 T/H11002 C.Public saving is the amount of tax reve-\\nnue that the government has left after paying for its spending. The government re-ceives Tin tax revenue and spends Gon goods and services. If Texceeds G,the\\ngovernment runs a budget surplus because it receives more money than it spends.\\nThis surplus of T/H11002 Grepresents public saving. If the government spends more\\nthan it receives in tax revenue, then Gis larger than T.In this case, the government\\nruns a budget deficit, and public saving T/H11002 Gis a negative number.\\nNow consider how these accounting identities are related to financial markets.\\nThe equation S/H11005Ireveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving mustnational saving (saving)\\nthe total income in theeconomy that remains afterpaying for consumption andgovernment purchases\\nprivate saving\\nthe income that householdshave left after paying for taxesand consumption\\npublic saving\\nthe tax revenue that the governmenthas left after paying for its spending\\nbudget surplus\\nan excess of tax revenue overgovernment spending\\nbudget deficit\\na shortfall of tax revenue fromgovernment spendingCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 275\\nbe equal to investment. Yet this fact raises some important questions: What mecha-\\nnisms lie behind this identity? What coordinates those people who are decidinghow much to save and those people who are deciding how much to invest? Theanswer is: the financial system. The bond market, the stock market, banks, mutualfunds, and other financial markets and intermediaries stand between the two sidesof the S/H11005Iequation. They take in the nation’s saving and direct it to the nation’s\\ninvestment.\\nTHE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT\\nThe terms saving and investment can sometimes be confusing. Most people use\\nthese terms casually and sometimes interchangeably. By contrast, the macroecon-omists who put together the national income accounts use these terms carefullyand distinctly.\\nConsider an example. Suppose that Larry earns more than he spends and de-\\nposits his unspent income in a bank or uses it to buy a bond or some stock from acorporation. Because Larry’s income exceeds his consumption, he adds to the na-tion’s saving. Larry might think of himself as “investing” his money, but a macro-economist would call Larry’s act saving rather than investment.\\nIn the language of macroeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of new\\ncapital, such as equipment or buildings. When Moe borrows from the bank tobuild himself a new house, he adds to the nation’s investment. Similarly, when the\\nUSING SOME OF YOUR INCOME TO BUY STOCK ?

Larry’s saving can be greater than his investment, and hecan deposit the excess in a bank. Moe’s saving can be less than his investment, andhe can borrow the shortfall from a bank. Banks and other financial institutionsmake these individual differences between saving and investment possible by al-lowing one person’s saving to finance another person’s investment.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define private saving, public saving, national saving, and\\ninvestment. How are they related?\\nTHE MARKET FOR LOANABLE FUNDS\\nHaving discussed some of the important financial institutions in our economy and\\nthe macroeconomic role of these institutions, we are ready to build a model of fi-nancial markets. Our purpose in building this model is to explain how financialmarkets coordinate the economy’s saving and investment. The model also gives usa tool with which we can analyze various government policies that influence sav-ing and investment.\\nTo keep things simple, we assume that the economy has only one financial\\nmarket, called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to de-\\nposit their saving, and all borrowers go to this market to get their loans. Thus, theterm loanable funds refers to all income that people have chosen to save and lend\\nout, rather than use for their own consumption. In the market for loanable funds,there is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of bor-rowing.\\nThe assumption of a single financial market, of course, is not literally true. As\\nwe have seen, the economy has many types of financial institutions. But, as we dis-cussed in Chapter 2, the art in building an economic model is simplifying theworld in order to explain it. For our purposes here, we can ignore the diversity offinancial institutions and assume that the economy has a single financial market.\\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LOANABLE FUNDS\\nThe economy’s market for loanable funds, like other markets in the economy, isgoverned by supply and demand. To understand how the market for loanablefunds operates, therefore, we first look at the sources of supply and demand inthat market.\\nThe supply of loanable funds comes from those people who have some extra\\nincome they want to save and lend out. This lending can occur directly, such aswhen a household buys a bond from a firm, or it can occur indirectly, such as whena household makes a deposit in a bank, which in turn uses the funds to makeloans. In both cases, saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds.market for loanable funds\\nthe market in which those whowant to save supply funds andthose who want to borrow toinvest demand fundsCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 277\\nThe demand for loanable funds comes from households and firms who wish\\nto borrow to make investments. This demand includes families taking out mort-gages to buy homes. It also includes firms borrowing to buy new equipment orbuild factories. In both cases, investment is the source of the demand for loanablefunds.\\nThe interest rate is the price of a loan. It represents the amount that borrowers\\npay for loans and the amount that lenders receive on their saving. Because a highinterest rate makes borrowing more expensive, the quantity of loanable funds de-manded falls as the interest rate rises. Similarly, because a high interest rate makessaving more attractive, the quantity of loanable funds supplied rises as the interestrate rises. In other words, the demand curve for loanable funds slopes downward,and the supply curve for loanable funds slopes upward.\\nFigure 13-1 shows the interest rate that balances the supply and demand for\\nloanable funds. In the equilibrium shown, the interest rate is 5 percent, and thequantity of loanable funds demanded and the quantity of loanable funds suppliedboth equal $1,200 billion. The adjustment of the interest rate to the equilibriumlevel occurs for the usual reasons. If the interest rate were lower than the equilib-rium level, the quantity of loanable funds supplied would be less than the quan-tity of loanable funds demanded. The resulting shortage of loanable funds wouldencourage lenders to raise the interest rate they charge. Conversely, if the interestrate were higher than the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds sup-plied would exceed the quantity of loanable funds demanded. As lenders com-peted for the scarce borrowers, interest rates would be driven down. In this way,\\n“Whoops! There go those darned interest rates again!”278 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nthe interest rate approaches the equilibrium level at which the supply and demand\\nfor loanable funds exactly balance.\\nRecall that economists distinguish between the real interest rate and the nom-\\ninal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported—the monetary return to saving and cost of borrowing. The real interest rate is thenominal interest rate corrected for inflation; it equals the nominal interest rate mi-nus the inflation rate. Because inflation erodes the value of money over time, thereal interest rate more accurately reflects the real return to saving and cost of bor-rowing. Therefore, the supply and demand for loanable funds depend on the real(rather than nominal) interest rate, and the equilibrium in Figure 13-1 should be in-terpreted as determining the real interest rate in the economy. For the rest of thischapter, when you see the term interest rate, you should remember that we are talk-\\ning about the real interest rate.\\nThis model of the supply and demand for loanable funds shows that financial\\nmarkets work much like other markets in the economy. In the market for milk, forinstance, the price of milk adjusts so that the quantity of milk supplied balancesthe quantity of milk demanded. In this way, the invisible hand coordinates the be-havior of dairy farmers and the behavior of milk drinkers. Once we realize thatsaving represents the supply of loanable funds and investment represents the de-mand, we can see how the invisible hand coordinates saving and investment.When the interest rate adjusts to balance supply and demand in the market forloanable funds, it coordinates the behavior of people who want to save (the sup-pliers of loanable funds) and the behavior of people who want to invest (the de-manders of loanable funds).\\nWe can now use this analysis of the market for loanable funds to examine var-\\nious government policies that affect the economy’s saving and investment. Be-cause this model is just supply and demand in a particular market, we analyze anypolicy using the three steps discussed in Chapter 4. First, we decide whether thepolicy shifts the supply curve or the demand curve. Second, we determine the di-rection of the shift. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how theequilibrium changes.Loanable Funds\\n(in billions of dollars)0Interest\\nRate\\n5%Supply\\nDemand\\n$1,200Figure 13-1\\nTHEMARKET FOR LOANABLE\\nFUNDS . The interest rate in the\\neconomy adjusts to balance thesupply and demand for loanablefunds. The supply of loanablefunds comes from nationalsaving, including both privatesaving and public saving. The demand for loanable funds comes from firms andhouseholds that want to borrowfor purposes of investment.Here the equilibrium interestrate is 5 percent, and $1,200billion of loanable funds aresupplied and demanded.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 279\\nImagine that someone offered\\nto give you $100 today or$100 in ten years. Whichwould you choose? This is aneasy question. Getting $100today is clearly better, becauseyou can always deposit themoney in a bank, still have it inten years, and earn interestalong the way. The lesson:Money today is more valuablethan the same amount ofmoney in the future.\\nNow consider a harder\\nquestion: Imagine that someone offered you $100 today or$200 in ten years. Which would you choose? To answerthis question, you need some way to compare sums ofmoney from different points in time. Economists do thiswith a concept called present value. The present value of\\nany future sum of money is the amount today that wouldbe needed, at current interest rates, to produce that fu-ture sum.\\nTo learn how to use the concept of present value, let’s\\nwork through a couple of simple problems:\\nQuestion: If you put $100 in a bank account today,\\nhow much will it be worth in Nyears? That is, what will be\\nthe future value of this $100?\\nAnswer: Let’s use rto denote the interest rate ex-\\npressed in decimal form (so an interest rate of 5 percentmeans r/H110050.05). If interest is paid each year, and if the in-\\nterest paid remains in the bank account to earn more in-terest (a process called compounding ), the $100 will\\nbecome (1 /H11001r) /H11003$100 after one year, (1 /H11001r) /H11003(1/H11001r)/H11003\\n$100 after two years, (1 /H11001r) /H11003(1 /H11001r) /H11003(1 /H11001r)/H11003 $100\\nafter three years, and so on. After Nyears, the $100 be-\\ncomes (1 /H11001r)\\nN/H11003$100. For example, if we are investing at\\nan interest rate of 5 percent for ten years, then the futurevalue of the $100 will be (1.05)\\n10/H11003$100, which is $163.\\nQuestion: Now suppose you are going to be paid $200\\nin Nyears. What is the present value of this future pay-\\nment? That is, how much would you have to deposit in abank right now to yield $200 in Nyears?\\nAnswer: To answer this question, just turn the previous\\nanswer on its head. In the last question, we computed a fu-ture value from a present value by multiplying by the factor\\n(1 /H11001r)\\nN. To compute a present value from a future value,\\nwe divide by the factor (1 /H11001r)N. Thus, the present value of\\n$200 in Nyears is $200/(1 /H11001r)N. If that amount is de-\\nposited in a bank today, after Nyears it would become\\n(1/H11001r)N/H11003[$200/(1 /H11001r)N], which is $200. For instance, ifthe interest rate is 5 percent, the present value of $200 in\\nten years is $200/(1.05)10, which is $123.\\nThis illustrates the general formula: If ris the interest rate,\\nthen an amount Xto be received in Nyears has present\\nvalue of X/(1 /H11001r)N.\\nLet’s now return to our earlier question: Should you\\nchoose $100 today or $200 in ten years? We can inferfrom our calculation of present value that if the interestrate is 5 percent, you should prefer the $200 in ten years.The future $200 has a present value of $123, which isgreater than $100. You are, therefore, better off waiting forthe future sum.\\nNotice that the answer to our question depends on the\\ninterest rate. If the interest rate were 8 percent, then the$200 in ten years would have a present value of $200/(1.08)\\n10, which is only $93. In this case, you should take\\nthe $100 today. Why should the interest rate matter foryour choice? The answer is that the higher the interest rate,the more you can earn by depositing your money at thebank, so the more attractive getting $100 today becomes.\\nThe concept of present value is useful in many appli-\\ncations, including the decisions that companies face whenevaluating investment projects. For instance, imagine thatGeneral Motors is thinking about building a new automobilefactory. Suppose that the factory will cost $100 million to-day and will yield the company $200 million in ten years.Should General Motors undertake the project? You can seethat this decision is exactly like the one we have beenstudying. To make its decision, the company will comparethe present value of the $200 million return to the $100million cost.\\nThe company’s decision, therefore, will depend on the\\ninterest rate. If the interest rate is 5 percent, then thepresent value of the $200 million return from the factory is$123 million, and the company will choose to pay the $100million cost. By contrast, if the interest rate is 8 percent,then the present value of the return is only $93 million, andthe company will decide to forgo the project. Thus, the con-cept of present value helps explain why investment—andthus the quantity of loanable funds demanded—declineswhen the interest rate rises.\\nHere is another application of present value: Suppose\\nyou win a million-dollar lottery, but the prize is going to bepaid out as $20,000 a year for 50 years. How much is theprize really worth? After performing 50 calculations similarto those above (one calculation for each payment) andadding up the results, you would learn that the presentvalue of this prize at a 7 percent interest rate is only$276,000. This is one way that state lotteries makemoney—by selling tickets in the present, and paying out\\nprizes in the future.FYI\\nPresent \\nValue\\n280 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nPOLICY 1: TAXES AND SAVING\\nAmerican families save a smaller fraction of their incomes than their counterparts\\nin many other countries, such as Japan and Germany. Although the reasons forthese international differences are unclear, many U.S. policymakers view the lowlevel of U.S. saving as a major problem. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in\\nChapter 1 is that a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to producegoods and services. And, as we discussed in the preceding chapter, saving is animportant long-run determinant of a nation’s productivity. If the United Statescould somehow raise its saving rate to the level that prevails in other countries, thegrowth rate of GDP would increase, and over time, U.S. citizens would enjoy ahigher standard of living.\\nAnother of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives.\\nMany economists have used this principle to suggest that the low saving rate inthe United States is at least partly attributable to tax laws that discourage saving.The U.S. federal government, as well as many state governments, collects revenueby taxing income, including interest and dividend income. To see the effects of thispolicy, consider a 25-year-old individual who saves $1,000 and buys a 30-yearbond that pays an interest rate of 9 percent. In the absence of taxes, the $1,000grows to $13,268 when the individual reaches age 55. Yet if that interest is taxed ata rate of, say, 33 percent, then the after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent. In thiscase, the $1,000 grows to only $5,743 after 30 years. The tax on interest income sub-stantially reduces the future payoff from current saving and, as a result, reducesthe incentive for people to save.\\nIn response to this problem, many economists and lawmakers have proposed\\nchanging the tax code to encourage greater saving. In 1995, for instance, whenCongressman Bill Archer of Texas became chairman of the powerful House Waysand Means Committee, he proposed replacing the current income tax with aconsumption tax. Under a consumption tax, income that is saved would not betaxed until the saving is later spent; in essence, a consumption tax is like the salestaxes that many states now use to collect revenue. A more modest proposal is toexpand eligibility for special accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts,that allow people to shelter some of their saving from taxation. Let’s consider theeffect of such a saving incentive on the market for loanable funds, as illustrated inFigure 13-2.\\nFirst, which curve would this policy affect? Because the tax change would al-\\nter the incentive for households to save at any given interest rate, it would affect the\\nquantity of loanable funds supplied at each interest rate. Thus, the supply of loan-able funds would shift. The demand for loanable funds would remain the same,because the tax change would not directly affect the amount that borrowers wantto borrow at any given interest rate.\\nSecond, which way would the supply curve shift? Because saving would be\\ntaxed less heavily than under current law, households would increase their savingby consuming a smaller fraction of their income. Households would use this addi-tional saving to increase their deposits in banks or to buy more bonds. The supplyof loanable funds would increase, and the supply curve would shift to the rightfrom S\\n1to S2, as shown in Figure 13-2.\\nFinally, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, the increased\\nsupply of loanable funds reduces the interest rate from 5 percent to 4 percent. Thelower interest rate raises the quantity of loanable funds demanded from $1,200\\nCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 281\\nbillion to $1,600 billion. That is, the shift in the supply curve moves the market\\nequilibrium along the demand curve. With a lower cost of borrowing, householdsand firms are motivated to borrow more to finance greater investment. Thus, if a\\nchange in the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest ratesand greater investment.\\nAlthough this analysis of the effects of increased saving is widely accepted\\namong economists, there is less consensus about what kinds of tax changes shouldbe enacted. Many economists endorse tax reform aimed at increasing saving in or-der to stimulate investment and growth. Yet others are skeptical that these taxchanges would have much effect on national saving. These skeptics also doubt theequity of the proposed reforms. They argue that, in many cases, the benefits of thetax changes would accrue primarily to the wealthy, who are least in need of tax re-lief. We examine this debate more fully in the final chapter of this book.\\nPOLICY 2: TAXES AND INVESTMENT\\nSuppose that Congress passed a law giving a tax reduction to any firm building anew factory. In essence, this is what Congress does when it institutes an investment\\ntax credit, which it does from time to time. Let’s consider the effect of such a law on\\nthe market for loanable funds, as illustrated in Figure 13-3.\\nFirst, would the law affect supply or demand? Because the tax credit would\\nreward firms that borrow and invest in new capital, it would alter investment atany given interest rate and, thereby, change the demand for loanable funds. Bycontrast, because the tax credit would not affect the amount that households saveat any given interest rate, it would not affect the supply of loanable funds.Loanable Funds\\n(in billions of dollars)0Interest\\nRate\\n4%5%Supply, S1 S2\\n$1,200 $1,6002. ...which\\nreduces theequilibriuminterest rate...\\n3. ...and rai ses the equilibrium\\nquantity of loanable funds.Demand1.

As a\\nresult, the equilibrium interestrate would fall, and the lowerinterest rate would stimulateinvestment. Here the equilibriuminterest rate falls from 5 percentto 4 percent, and the equilibriumquantity of loanable funds savedand invested rises from $1,200billion to $1,600 billion.282 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nSecond, which way would the demand curve shift? Because firms would have\\nan incentive to increase investment at any interest rate, the quantity of loanablefunds demanded would be higher at any given interest rate. Thus, the demandcurve for loanable funds would move to the right, as shown by the shift from D\\n1to\\nD2in the figure.\\nThird, consider how the equilibrium would change. In Figure 13-3, the in-\\ncreased demand for loanable funds raises the interest rate from 5 percent to 6 per-cent, and the higher interest rate in turn increases the quantity of loanable fundssupplied from $1,200 billion to $1,400 billion, as households respond by increasingthe amount they save. This change in household behavior is represented here as amovement along the supply curve. Thus, if a change in the tax laws encouraged\\ngreater investment, the result would be higher interest rates and greater saving.\\nPOLICY 3:\\nGOVERNMENT BUDGET DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES\\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, one of the most pressing policy issues was the\\nsize of the government budget deficit. Recall that a budget deficit is an excess of\\ngovernment spending over tax revenue. Governments finance budget deficits byborrowing in the bond market, and the accumulation of past government borrow-ing is called the government debt. In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. federal govern-\\nment ran large budget deficits, resulting in a rapidly growing government debt. Asa result, much public debate centered on the effects of these deficits both on the al-location of the economy’s scarce resources and on long-term economic growth.Loanable Funds\\n(in billions of dollars)0Interest\\nRate\\n5%6%\\n$1,200 $1,4001.

If the\\npassage of an investment taxcredit encouraged U.S. firms to invest more, the demand forloanable funds would increase.As a result, the equilibriuminterest rate would rise, andthe higher interest rate wouldstimulate saving. Here, when thedemand curve shifts from D\\n1to\\nD2, the equilibrium interest rate\\nrises from 5 percent to 6 percent,and the equilibrium quantityof loanable funds saved andinvested rises from $1,200 billionto $1,400 billion.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 283\\nWe can analyze the effects of a budget deficit by following our three steps in\\nthe market for loanable funds, which is illustrated in Figure 13-4. First, whichcurve shifts when the budget deficit rises? Recall that national saving—the sourceof the supply of loanable funds—is composed of private saving and public saving.A change in the government budget deficit represents a change in public savingand, thereby, in the supply of loanable funds. Because the budget deficit does notinfluence the amount that households and firms want to borrow to finance invest-ment at any given interest rate, it does not alter the demand for loanable funds.\\nSecond, which way does the supply curve shift? When the government runs a\\nbudget deficit, public saving is negative, and this reduces national saving. In otherwords, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it reduces thesupply of loanable funds available to finance investment by households and firms.Thus, a budget deficit shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left fromS\\n1to S2, as shown in Figure 13-4.\\nThird, we can compare the old and new equilibria. In the figure, when the\\nbudget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds, the interest rate rises from5 percent to 6 percent. This higher interest rate then alters the behavior of thehouseholds and firms that participate in the loan market. In particular, manydemanders of loanable funds are discouraged by the higher interest rate. Fewerfamilies buy new homes, and fewer firms choose to build new factories. The fall ininvestment because of government borrowing is called crowding out and is repre-\\nsented in the figure by the movement along the demand curve from a quantity of$1,200 billion in loanable funds to a quantity of $800 billion. That is, when the gov-ernment borrows to finance its budget deficit, it crowds out private borrowerswho are trying to finance investment.Loanable Funds\\n(in billions of dollars)0Interest\\nRate\\n$800 $1,200\\n3. ...and r educes the equilibrium\\nquantity of loanable funds.S2\\n2. ...whichraises theequilibriuminterest rate...Supply, \\nS1\\nDemand5%6%1.

Making economic policy, how-ever, is not as simple as this observation may make it sound. A good exampleoccurred in the late 1990s, when the U.S. government found itself with a budgetsurplus, and much debate centered on what to do with it.\\nMany policymakers favored leaving the budget surplus alone, rather than\\ndissipating it with a spending increase or tax cut. They based their conclusionon the analysis we have just seen: Using the surplus to retire some of the gov-ernment debt would stimulate private investment and economic growth.\\nOther policymakers took a different view. Some thought the surplus should\\nbe used to increase government spending on infrastructure and education be-cause, they argued, the return to these public investments is greater than thetypical return to private investment. Some thought taxes should be cut, arguingthat lower tax rates would distort decisionmaking less and lead to a more effi-cient allocation of resources; they also cautioned that without such a tax cut,Thus, the most basic lesson about budget deficits follows directly from their ef-\\nfects on the supply and demand for loanable funds: When the government reduces\\nnational saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment falls.Because investment is important for long-run economic growth, government bud-get deficits reduce the economy’s growth rate.\\nGovernment budget surpluses work just the opposite as budget deficits. When\\ngovernment collects more in tax revenue than it spends, its saves the difference byretiring some of the outstanding government debt. This budget surplus, or publicsaving, contributes to national saving. Thus, a budget surplus increases the supply of\\nloanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment. Higher investment,\\nin turn, means greater capital accumulation and more rapid economic growth.\\n“Our debt-reduction\\nplan is simple, but itwill require a greatdeal of money.”\\nCHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 285\\nCongress would be tempted to spend the surplus on “pork barrel” projects of\\ndubious value.\\nAs this book was going to press, the debate over the budget surplus was\\nstill raging. There is room for reasonable people to disagree. The right policydepends on how valuable you view private investment, how valuable you viewpublic investment, how distortionary you view taxation, and how reliable youview the political process.\\nCASE STUDY\\nTHE HISTORY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT\\nHow indebted is the U.S. government? The answer to this question varies sub-\\nstantially over time. Figure 13-5 shows the debt of the U.S. federal governmentexpressed as a percentage of U.S. GDP . It shows that the government debt hasfluctuated from zero in 1836 to 107 percent of GDP in 1945. In recent years, gov-ernment debt has been about 50 percent of GDP .\\nThe behavior of the debt–GDP ratio is one gauge of what’s happening with\\nthe government’s finances. Because GDP is a rough measure of the govern-ment’s tax base, a declining debt–GDP ratio indicates that the government in-debtedness is shrinking relative to its ability to raise tax revenue. This suggeststhat the government is, in some sense, living within its means. By contrast, a ris-ing debt–GDP ratio means that the government indebtedness is increasing rela-tive to its ability to raise tax revenue. It is often interpreted as meaning thatfiscal policy—government spending and taxes—cannot be sustained forever atcurrent levels.\\nThroughout history, the primary cause of fluctuations in government\\ndebt is war. When wars occur, government spending on national defense rises\\nPercent\\nof GDP\\n1790 1810 1830 1850 1870 1890 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990Revolutionary\\nWar\\n2010Civil\\nWar World War IWorld War II\\n020406080100120Figure 13-5\\nTHEU.S. G OVERNMENT DEBT.\\nThe debt of the U.S. federal\\ngovernment, expressed here as a percentage of GDP , has variedsubstantially throughout history.It reached its highest level afterthe large expenditures of WorldWar II, but then declined through-out the 1950s and 1960s. It beganrising again in the early 1980swhen Ronald Reagan’s tax cutswere not accompanied by similarcuts in government spending.It then stabilized and evendeclined slightly in the late 1990s.\\nSource: U.S. Department of Treasury; U.S.\\nDepartment of Commerce; and T. S. Berry,“Production and Population since 1789,”Bostwick Paper No. 6, Richmond, 1988.286 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nsubstantially to pay for soldiers and military equipment. Taxes typically rise as\\nwell but by much less than the increase in spending. The result is a budgetdeficit and increasing government debt. When the war is over, governmentspending declines, and the debt–GDP ratio starts declining as well.\\nThere are two reasons to believe that debt financing of war is an appro-\\npriate policy. First, it allows the government to keep tax rates smooth over time.Without debt financing, tax rates would have to rise sharply during wars, andas we saw in Chapter 8, this would cause a substantial decline in economicefficiency. Second, debt financing of wars shifts part of the cost of wars to fu-ture generations, who will have to pay off the government debt. This is argu-ably a fair distribution of the burden, for future generations get some of the benefit when one generation fights a war to defend the nation against foreignaggressors.\\nOne large increase in government debt that cannot be explained by war is\\nthe increase that occurred beginning around 1980. When President Ronald Rea-gan took office in 1981, he was committed to smaller government and lowertaxes. Yet he found cutting government spending to be more difficult politicallythan cutting taxes. The result was the beginning of a period of large budgetdeficits that continued not only through Reagan’s time in office but also formany years thereafter. As a result, government debt rose from 26 percent ofGDP in 1980 to 50 percent of GDP in 1993.\\nAs we discussed earlier, government budget deficits reduce national sav-\\ning, investment, and long-run economic growth, and this is precisely why therise in government debt during the 1980s troubled so many economists. Policy-makers from both political parties accepted this basic argument and viewedpersistent budget deficits as an important policy problem. When Bill Clintonmoved into the Oval Office in 1993, deficit reduction was his first major goal.Similarly, when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, deficit reduc-tion was high on their legislative agenda. Both of these efforts substantially re-duced the size of the government budget deficit, and it eventually turned into asmall surplus. As a result, by the late 1990s, the debt–GDP ratio was decliningonce again.\\nQUICK QUIZ: If more Americans adopted a “live for today” approach to\\nlife, how would this affect saving, investment, and the interest rate?\\nCONCLUSION\\n“Neither a borrower nor a lender be,” Polonius advises his son in Shake-speare’s Hamlet. If everyone followed this advice, this chapter would have been\\nunnecessary.\\nFew economists would agree with Polonius. In our economy, people borrow\\nand lend often, and usually for good reason. You may borrow one day to start yourown business or to buy a home. And people may lend to you in the hope that theinterest you pay will allow them to enjoy a more prosperous retirement. The fi-nancial system has the job of coordinating all this borrowing and lending activity.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 287\\nIn many ways, financial markets are like other markets in the economy. The\\nprice of loanable funds—the interest rate—is governed by the forces of supply anddemand, just as other prices in the economy are. And we can analyze shifts in sup-ply or demand in financial markets as we do in other markets. One of the Ten Prin-\\nciples of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way\\nto organize economic activity. This principle applies to financial markets as well.When financial markets bring the supply and demand for loanable funds into bal-ance, they help allocate the economy’s scarce resources to their most efficient use.\\nIn one way, however, financial markets are special. Financial markets, unlike\\nmost other markets, serve the important role of linking the present and the future.Those who supply loanable funds—savers—do so because they want to convertsome of their current income into future purchasing power. Those who demandloanable funds—borrowers—do so because they want to invest today in order tohave additional capital in the future to produce goods and services. Thus, well-functioning financial markets are important not only for current generations butalso for future generations who will inherit many of the resulting benefits.\\nN The U.S. financial system is made up of many types of\\nfinancial institutions, such as the bond market, the stockmarket, banks, and mutual funds. All these institutionsact to direct the resources of households who want tosave some of their income into the hands of householdsand firms who want to borrow.\\nN National income accounting identities reveal someimportant relationships among macroeconomicvariables. In particular, for a closed economy, nationalsaving must equal investment. Financial institutions arethe mechanism through which the economy matchesone person’s saving with another person’s investment.\\nN The interest rate is determined by the supply anddemand for loanable funds. The supply of loanablefunds comes from households who want to save some\\nof their income and lend it out. The demand forloanable funds comes from households and firms whowant to borrow for investment. To analyze how anypolicy or event affects the interest rate, one mustconsider how it affects the supply and demand forloanable funds.\\nN National saving equals private saving plus publicsaving. A government budget deficit represents negativepublic saving and, therefore, reduces national savingand the supply of loanable funds available to financeinvestment.

A job loss means a lower living standard in the present, anxiety aboutthe future, and reduced self-esteem. It is not surprising, therefore, that politicianscampaigning for office often speak about how their proposed policies will helpcreate jobs.\\nIn the preceding two chapters we have seen some of the forces that determine\\nthe level and growth of a country’s standard of living. A country that saves and in-vests a high fraction of its income, for instance, enjoys more rapid growth in itscapital stock and its GDP than a similar country that saves and invests less. Aneven more obvious determinant of a country’s standard of living is the amount ofunemployment it typically experiences. People who would like to work but cannotUNEMPLOYMENT \\nAND ITS NATURAL RATE\\n291292 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nfind a job are not contributing to the economy’s production of goods and services.\\nAlthough some degree of unemployment is inevitable in a complex economy withthousands of firms and millions of workers, the amount of unemployment variessubstantially over time and across countries. When a country keeps its workers asfully employed as possible, it achieves a higher level of GDP than it would if it leftmany of its workers standing idle.\\nThis chapter begins our study of unemployment. The problem of unemploy-\\nment is usefully divided into two categories—the long-run problem and the short-run problem. The economy’s natural rate of unemployment refers to the amount of\\nunemployment that the economy normally experiences. Cyclical unemployment\\nrefers to the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate,and it is closely associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity.Cyclical unemployment has its own explanation, which we defer until we studyshort-run economic fluctuations later in this book. In this chapter we discuss thedeterminants of an economy’s natural rate of unemployment. As we will see, thedesignation natural does not imply that this rate of unemployment is desirable.\\nNor does it imply that it is constant over time or impervious to economic policy. Itmerely means that this unemployment does not go away on its own even in thelong run.\\nWe begin the chapter by looking at some of the relevant facts that describe un-\\nemployment. In particular, we examine three questions: How does the govern-ment measure the economy’s rate of unemployment? What problems arise ininterpreting the unemployment data? How long are the unemployed typicallywithout work?\\nWe then turn to the reasons why economies always experience some unem-\\nployment and the ways in which policymakers can help the unemployed. We dis-cuss four explanations for the economy’s natural rate of unemployment: jobsearch, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages. As we will see, long-run unemployment does not arise from a single problem that has a single solution.Instead, it reflects a variety of related problems. As a result, there is no easy wayfor policymakers to reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment and, atthe same time, to alleviate the hardships experienced by the unemployed.\\nIDENTIFYING UNEMPLOYMENT\\nWe begin this chapter by examining more precisely what the term unemployment\\nmeans. We consider how the government measures unemployment, what prob-lems arise in interpreting the unemployment data, and how long the typical spellof unemployment lasts.\\nHOW IS UNEMPLOYMENT MEASURED?\\nMeasuring unemployment is the job of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), whichis part of the Department of Labor. Every month the BLS produces data on unem-ployment and on other aspects of the labor market, such as types of employment,CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 293\\nlength of the average workweek, and the duration of unemployment. These data\\ncome from a regular survey of about 60,000 households, called the Current Popu-lation Survey.\\nBased on the answers to survey questions, the BLS places each adult (aged six-\\nteen and older) in each surveyed household into one of three categories:\\nNEmployed\\nNUnemployed\\nNNot in the labor force\\nA person is considered employed if he or she spent most of the previous week\\nworking at a paid job. A person is unemployed if he or she is on temporary layoff,is looking for a job, or is waiting for the start date of a new job. A person who fitsneither of the first two categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker, or re-tiree, is not in the labor force. Figure 14-1 shows this breakdown for 1998.\\nOnce the BLS has placed all the individuals covered by the survey in a cate-\\ngory, it computes various statistics to summarize the state of the labor market. TheBLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed:\\nLabor force /H11005Number employed /H11001number of unemployed\\nAdult\\npopulation\\n(205.2 million)Labor force\\n(137.7 million)Employed\\n(131.5 million)\\nNot in labor force\\n(67.5 million)Unemployed (6.2 million)Figure 14-1\\nTHEBREAKDOWN OF THE\\nPOPULATION IN 1998.

The labor-force participation rate, like the unemployment rate, iscomputed both for the entire adult population and for more narrow groups.\\nTo see how these data are computed, consider the figures for 1998. In that year,\\n131.5 million people were employed, and 6.2 million people were unemployed.The labor force was\\nLabor force /H11005131.5 /H110016.2 /H11005137.7 million.\\nThe unemployment rate was\\nUnemployment rate /H11005(6.2/137.7) /H11003100 /H110054.5 percent.\\nBecause the adult population was 205.2 million, the labor-force participation\\nrate was\\nLabor-force participation rate /H11005(137.7/205.2) /H11003100 /H1100567.1 percent.\\nHence, in 1998, two-thirds of the U.S. adult population were participating in the \\nlabor market, and 4.5 percent of those labor-market participants were with-out work.\\nTable 14-1 shows the statistics on unemployment and labor-force participation\\nfor various groups within the U.S. population. Three comparisons are most appar-ent. First, women have lower rates of labor-force participation than men, but oncein the labor force, women have similar rates of unemployment. Second, blackshave similar rates of labor-force participation as whites, and they have muchhigher rates of unemployment. Third, teenagers have lower rates of labor-forceparticipation and much higher rates of unemployment than the overall popula-tion. More generally, these data show that labor-market experiences vary widelyamong groups within the economy.\\nThe BLS data on the labor market also allow economists and policymakers to\\nmonitor changes in the economy over time. Figure 14-2 shows the unemploymentrate in the United States since 1960. The figure shows that the economy always hassome unemployment and that the amount changes from year to year.

Social commentators have pointed to many causes for this change. In part,it is attributable to new technologies such as the washing machine, clothesdryer, refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, which have reduced the amount oftime required to complete routine household tasks. In part, it is attributable toimproved birth control, which has reduced the number of children born to thetypical family. And, of course, this change in women’s role is also partly at-tributable to changing political and social attitudes. Together these develop-ments have had a profound impact on society in general and on the economy inparticular.\\nNowhere is that impact more obvious than in data on labor-force participa-\\ntion. Figure 14-3 shows the labor-force participation rates of men and women inthe United States since 1950. Just after World War II, men and women had verydifferent roles in society. Only 33 percent of women were working or looking forwork, in contrast to 87 percent of men. Over the past several decades, the dif-ference between the participation rates of men and women has gradually di-minished, as growing numbers of women have entered the labor force andsome men have left it. Data for 1998 show that 60 percent of women were in thelabor force, in contrast to 75 percent of men. As measured by labor-force partic-ipation, men and women are now playing a more equal role in the economy.\\nThe increase in women’s labor-force participation is easy to understand, but\\nthe fall in men’s may seem puzzling. There are several reasons for this decline.short-run economic fluctuations, including the year-to-year fluctuations in unem-ployment around its natural rate. In the rest of this chapter, however, we ignore theshort-run fluctuations and examine why unemployment is a chronic problem formarket economies.\\nMORE WOMEN ARE WORKING\\nNOW THAN EVER BEFORE .\\nCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 297\\nFirst, young men now stay in school longer than their fathers and grandfathers\\ndid. Second, older men now retire earlier and live longer. Third, with morewomen employed, more fathers now stay at home to raise their children. Full-time students, retirees, and stay-at-home fathers are all counted as out of thelabor force.\\nDOES THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE MEASURE\\nWHAT WE WANT IT TO?\\nMeasuring the amount of unemployment in the economy might seem straightfor-\\nward. In fact, it is not. Whereas it is easy to distinguish between a person with afull-time job and a person who is not working at all, it is much harder to distin-guish between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the laborforce.\\nMovements into and out of the labor force are, in fact, very common. More\\nthan one-third of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force. Theseentrants include young workers looking for their first jobs, such as recent collegegraduates. They also include, in greater numbers, older workers who had previ-ously left the labor force but have now returned to look for work. Moreover, not allunemployment ends with the job seeker finding a job. Almost half of all spells ofunemployment end when the unemployed person leaves the labor force.\\nBecause people move into and out of the labor force so often, statistics on un-\\nemployment are difficult to interpret. On the one hand, some of those who reportbeing unemployed may not, in fact, be trying hard to find a job. They may becalling themselves unemployed because they want to qualify for a government\\n100\\n80604020\\n0\\n1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 '98Labor-Force\\nParticipation\\nRate (in percent)\\nWomenMenFigure 14-3\\nLABOR -FORCE PARTICIPATION\\nRATES FOR MEN AND WOMEN\\nSINCE 1950.

On the otherhand, some of those who report being out of the labor force may, in fact, want towork. These individuals may have tried to find a job but have given up after anunsuccessful search. Such individuals, called discouraged workers, do not show\\nup in unemployment statistics, even though they are truly workers without jobs.According to most estimates, adding discouraged workers would increase themeasured unemployment rate by about one-half of one percentage point.\\nThere is no easy way to fix the unemployment rate as reported by the BLS to\\nmake it a more reliable indicator of conditions in the labor market. In the end, it isbest to view the reported unemployment rate as a useful but imperfect measure ofjoblessness.\\nHOW LONG ARE THE UNEMPLOYED WITHOUT WORK?\\nIn judging how serious the problem of unemployment is, one question to consideris whether unemployment is typically a short-term or long-term condition. If un-employment is short-term, one might conclude that it is not a big problem. Work-ers may require a few weeks between jobs to find the openings that best suit theirtastes and skills. Yet if unemployment is long-term, one might conclude that it is aserious problem. Workers unemployed for many months are more likely to suffereconomic and psychological hardship.\\nBecause the duration of unemployment can affect our view about how big a\\nproblem unemployment is, economists have devoted much energy to studyingdata on the duration of unemployment spells. In this work, they have uncovered aresult that is important, subtle, and seemingly contradictory: Most spells of unem-\\nployment are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.\\nTo see how this statement can be true, consider an example. Suppose that you\\nvisited the government’s unemployment office every week for a year to survey theunemployed. Each week you find that there are four unemployed workers. Threeof these workers are the same individuals for the whole year, while the fourth per-son changes every week. Based on this experience, would you say that unemploy-ment is typically short-term or long-term?\\nSome simple calculations help answer this question. In this example, you meet\\na total of 55 unemployed people; 52 of them are unemployed for one week, andthree are unemployed for the full year. This means that 52/55, or 95 percent, of un-employment spells end in one week. Thus, most spells of unemployment are short.Yet consider the total amount of unemployment. The three people unemployed forone year (52 weeks) make up a total of 156 weeks of unemployment. Together withthe 52 people unemployed for one week, this makes 208 weeks of unemployment.In this example, 156/208, or 75 percent, of unemployment is attributable to thoseindividuals who are unemployed for a full year. Thus, most unemployment ob-served at any given time is long-term.\\nThis subtle conclusion implies that economists and policymakers must be\\ncareful when interpreting data on unemployment and when designing policies tohelp the unemployed. Most people who become unemployed will soon find jobs.Yet most of the economy’s unemployment problem is attributable to the relativelyfew workers who are jobless for long periods of time.discouraged workers\\nindividuals who would like to workbut have given up looking for a jobCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 299\\nWHY ARE THERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED?\\nWe have discussed how the government measures the amount of unemployment,\\nthe problems that arise in interpreting unemployment statistics, and the findingsof labor economists on the duration of unemployment. You should now have agood idea about what unemployment is.\\nThis discussion, however, has not explained why economies experience un-\\nemployment. In most markets in the economy, prices adjust to bring quantity sup-plied and quantity demanded into balance. In an ideal labor market, wages wouldadjust to balance the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor de-manded. This adjustment of wages would ensure that all workers are always fullyemployed.\\nOf course, reality does not resemble this ideal. There are always some workers\\nwithout jobs, even when the overall economy is doing well. In other words, theunemployment rate never falls to zero; instead, it fluctuates around the naturalrate of unemployment. To understand this natural rate, we now examine the rea-sons why actual labor markets depart from the ideal of full employment.\\nTo preview our conclusions, we will find that there are four ways to explain\\nunemployment in the long run. The first explanation is that it takes time for work-ers to search for the jobs that are best suited for them. The unemployment that re-sults from the process of matching workers and jobs is sometimes called frictional\\nunemployment, and it is often thought to explain relatively short spells of unem-\\nployment.\\nThe next three explanations for unemployment suggest that the number of\\njobs available in some labor markets may be insufficient to give a job to everyonewho wants one. This occurs when the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quan-tity demanded. Unemployment of this sort is sometimes called structural unem-\\nployment, and it is often thought to explain longer spells of unemployment. As we\\nwill see, this kind of unemployment results when wages are, for some reason, setabove the level that brings supply and demand into equilibrium. We will examinethree possible reasons for an above-equilibrium wage: minimum-wage laws,unions, and efficiency wages.\\nQUICK QUIZ: How is the unemployment rate measured? NHow might\\nthe unemployment rate overstate the amount of joblessness? How might itunderstate it?\\nJOB SEARCH\\nOne reason why economies always experience some unemployment is job search.Job search is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs. If all workers\\nand all jobs were the same, so that all workers were equally well suited for all jobs,job search would not be a problem. Laid-off workers would quickly find newjobs that were well suited for them. But, in fact, workers differ in their tastes andskills, jobs differ in their attributes, and information about job candidates and jobfrictional unemployment\\nunemployment that results becauseit takes time for workers to searchfor the jobs that best suit theirtastes and skills\\nstructural unemployment\\nunemployment that results becausethe number of jobs available insome labor markets is insufficientto provide a job for everyonewho wants one\\njob search\\nthe process by which workersfind appropriate jobs giventheir tastes and skills300 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nvacancies is disseminated slowly among the many firms and households in the\\neconomy.\\nWHY SOME FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS INEVITABLE\\nFrictional unemployment is often the result of changes in the demand for laboramong different firms. When consumers decide that they prefer Compaq over Dellcomputers, Compaq increases employment, and Dell lays off workers. The formerDell workers must now search for new jobs, and Compaq must decide which newworkers to hire for the various jobs that have opened up. The result of this transi-tion is a period of unemployment.\\nSimilarly, because different regions of the country produce different goods,\\nemployment can rise in one region while it falls in another. Consider, for instance,what happens when the world price of oil falls. Oil-producing firms in Texas re-spond to the lower price by cutting back on production and employment. At thesame time, cheaper gasoline stimulates car sales, so auto-producing firms inMichigan raise production and employment. Changes in the composition of de-mand among industries or regions are called sectoral shifts. Because it takes time for\\nworkers to search for jobs in the new sectors, sectoral shifts temporarily cause un-employment.\\nFrictional unemployment is inevitable simply because the economy is always\\nchanging. A century ago, the four industries with the largest employment in theUnited States were cotton goods, woolen goods, men’s clothing, and lumber. To-day, the four largest industries are autos, aircraft, communications, and electricalcomponents. As this transition took place, jobs were created in some firms, andjobs were destroyed in others. The end result of this process has been higher pro-ductivity and higher living standards. But, along the way, workers in declining in-dustries found themselves out of work and searching for new jobs.\\nData show that at least 10 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs are destroyed\\nevery year. In addition, more than 3 percent of workers leave their jobs in a typicalmonth, sometimes because they realize that the jobs are not a good match for theirtastes and skills. Many of these workers, especially younger ones, find new jobsat higher wages. This churning of the labor force is normal in a well-functioningand dynamic market economy, but the result is some amount of frictionalunemployment.\\nPUBLIC POLICY AND JOB SEARCH\\nEven if some frictional unemployment is inevitable, the precise amount is not. Thefaster information spreads about job openings and worker availability, the morerapidly the economy can match workers and firms. The Internet, for instance, mayhelp facilitate job search and reduce frictional unemployment. In addition, publicpolicy may play a role. If policy can reduce the time it takes unemployed workersto find new jobs, it can reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment.\\nGovernment programs try to facilitate job search in various ways. One way is\\nthrough government-run employment agencies, which give out information aboutjob vacancies. Another way is through public training programs, which aim toease the transition of workers from declining to growing industries and to helpCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 301\\ndisadvantaged groups escape poverty. Advocates of these programs believe that\\nthey make the economy operate more efficiently by keeping the labor force morefully employed, and that they reduce the inequities inherent in a constantly chang-ing market economy.\\nCritics of these programs question whether the government should get in-\\nvolved with the process of job search. They argue that it is better to let the privatemarket match workers and jobs. In fact, most job search in our economy takesplace without intervention by the government. Newspaper ads, job newsletters,college placement offices, headhunters, and word of mouth all help spread infor-mation about job openings and job candidates. Similarly, much worker educationis done privately, either through schools or through on-the-job training. These crit-ics contend that the government is no better—and most likely worse—at dissemi-nating the right information to the right workers and deciding what kinds ofworker training would be most valuable. They claim that these decisions are bestmade privately by workers and employers.\\nUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\\nOne government program that increases the amount of frictional unemployment,without intending to do so, is unemployment insurance. This program is de-\\nsigned to offer workers partial protection against job loss. The unemployed whoquit their jobs, were fired for cause, or just entered the labor force are not eligible.Benefits are paid only to the unemployed who were laid off because their previousemployers no longer needed their skills. Although the terms of the program varyover time and across states, a typical American worker covered by unemploymentinsurance receives 50 percent of his or her former wages for 26 weeks.\\nWhile unemployment insurance reduces the hardship of unemployment, it\\nalso increases the amount of unemployment. The explanation is based on one ofthe Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives. Because\\nunemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed de-vote less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive job of-fers. In addition, because unemployment insurance makes unemployment lessonerous, workers are less likely to seek guarantees of job security when they ne-gotiate with employers over the terms of employment.\\nMany studies by labor economists have examined the incentive effects of un-\\nemployment insurance. One study examined an experiment run by the state of Illi-nois in 1985. When unemployed workers applied to collect unemploymentinsurance benefits, the state randomly selected some of them and offered each a$500 bonus if they found new jobs within 11 weeks. This group was then com-pared to a control group not offered the incentive. The average spell of unemploy-ment for the group offered the bonus was 7 percent shorter than the average spellfor the control group. This experiment shows that the design of the unemploymentinsurance system influences the effort that the unemployed devote to job search.\\nSeveral other studies examined search effort by following a group of workers\\nover time. Unemployment insurance benefits, rather than lasting forever, usuallyrun out after six months or a year. These studies found that when the unemployedbecome ineligible for benefits, the probability of their finding a new job risesmarkedly. Thus, receiving unemployment insurance benefits does reduce thesearch effort of the unemployed.unemployment insurance\\na government program that partiallyprotects workers’ incomes whenthey become unemployed\\n302 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nMANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE UN -\\nemployment insurance that is far moregenerous than that offered to U.S.workers, and some economists believethat these programs explain the highEuropean unemployment rates.

Is this unemployment undesirable?What public policies might affect the amount of unemployment caused by thisprice change?\\nMINIMUM-WAGE LAWS\\nHaving seen how frictional unemployment results from the process of matchingworkers and jobs, let’s now examine how structural unemployment results whenthe number of jobs is insufficient for the number of workers.\\nTo understand structural unemployment, we begin by reviewing how un-\\nemployment arises from minimum-wage laws—a topic we first analyzed inChapter 6. Although minimum wages are not the predominant reason for unem-ployment in our economy, they have an important effect on certain groups withparticularly high unemployment rates. Moreover, the analysis of minimum wagesis a natural place to start because, as we will see, it can be used to understand someof the other reasons for structural unemployment.\\nFigure 14-4 reviews the basic economics of a minimum wage. When a\\nminimum-wage law forces the wage to remain above the level that balances sup-ply and demand, it raises the quantity of labor supplied and reduces the quantityof labor demanded compared to the equilibrium level. There is a surplus of labor.Because there are more workers willing to work than there are jobs, some workersare unemployed.\\nBecause we discussed minimum-wage laws extensively in Chapter 6, we will\\nnot discuss them further here. It is, however, important to note why minimum-wage laws are not a predominant reason for unemployment: Most workers in theeconomy have wages well above the legal minimum. Minimum-wage laws arebinding most often for the least skilled and least experienced members of the laborforce, such as teenagers. It is only among these workers that minimum-wage lawsexplain the existence of unemployment.\\nAlthough Figure 14-4 is drawn to show the effects of a minimum-wage law, it\\nalso illustrates a more general lesson: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for\\nany reason, the result is unemployment. Minimum-wage laws are just one reason why304 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nwages may be “too high.” In the remaining two sections of this chapter, we con-\\nsider two other reasons why wages may be kept above the equilibrium level—unions and efficiency wages. The basic economics of unemployment in these casesis the same as that shown in Figure 14-4, but these explanations of unemploymentcan apply to many more of the economy’s workers.\\nAt this point, however, we should stop and notice that the structural unem-\\nployment that arises from an above-equilibrium wage is, in an important sense,different from the frictional unemployment that arises from the process of jobsearch. The need for job search is not due to the failure of wages to balance laborsupply and labor demand. When job search is the explanation for unemployment,workers are searching for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills. By contrast,\\nwhen the wage is above the equilibrium level, the quantity of labor supplied ex-ceeds the quantity of labor demanded, and workers are unemployed because theyare waiting for jobs to open up.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the supply curve and the demand curve for a labor\\nmarket in which the wage is fixed above the equilibrium level.

In\\nthe 1940s and 1950s, when unions were at their peak, about a third of the U.S. laborforce was unionized. Moreover, unions continue to play a large role in manyEuropean countries. In Sweden and Denmark, for instance, more than three-fourths of workers belong to unions.\\nTHE ECONOMICS OF UNIONS\\nA union is a type of cartel. Like any cartel, a union is a group of sellers acting to-gether in the hope of exerting their joint market power. Most workers in the U.S.economy discuss their wages, benefits, and working conditions with their em-ployers as individuals. By contrast, workers in a union do so as a group. Theprocess by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is called col-\\nlective bargaining.\\nWhen a union bargains with a firm, it asks for higher wages, better benefits,\\nand better working conditions than the firm would offer in the absence of a union.If the union and the firm do not reach agreement, the union can organize a with-drawal of labor from the firm, called a strike. Because a strike reduces production,\\nsales, and profit, a firm facing a strike threat is likely to agree to pay higher wagesthan it otherwise would. Economists who study the effects of unions typically findthat union workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar workers who donot belong to unions.\\nWhen a union raises the wage above the equilibrium level, it raises the quan-\\ntity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of labor demanded, resulting in un-employment. Those workers who remain employed are better off, but those whowere previously employed and are now unemployed at the higher wage are worseoff. Indeed, unions are often thought to cause conflict between different groups ofworkers—between the insiders who benefit from high union wages and the out-\\nsiders who do not get the union jobs.\\nThe outsiders can respond to their status in one of two ways. Some of them\\nremain unemployed and wait for the chance to become insiders and earn the highunion wage. Others take jobs in firms that are not unionized. Thus, when unionsraise wages in one part of the economy, the supply of labor increases in other partsof the economy. This increase in labor supply, in turn, reduces wages in industriesthat are not unionized. In other words, workers in unions reap the benefit of col-lective bargaining, while workers not in unions bear some of the cost.\\nThe role of unions in the economy depends in part on the laws that govern\\nunion organization and collective bargaining. Normally, explicit agreementsamong members of a cartel are illegal. If firms that sell a common product were toagree to set a high price for that product, the agreement would be a “conspiracy inrestraint of trade.” The government would prosecute these firms in civil and crim-inal court for violating the antitrust laws. By contrast, unions are exempt fromthese laws. The policymakers who wrote the antitrust laws believed that workersneeded greater market power as they bargained with employers. Indeed, variouslaws are designed to encourage the formation of unions. In particular, the WagnerAct of 1935 prevents employers from interfering when workers try to organizeunions and requires employers to bargain with unions in good faith. The NationalLabor Relations Board (NLRB) is the government agency that enforces workers’right to unionize.collective bargaining\\nthe process by which unionsand firms agree on theterms of employment\\nstrike\\nthe organized withdrawal oflabor from a firm by a union306 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nLegislation affecting the market power of unions is a perennial topic of politi-\\ncal debate. State lawmakers sometimes debate right-to-work laws, which give work-\\ners in a unionized firm the right to choose whether to join the union. In the absenceof such laws, unions can insist during collective bargaining that firms make unionmembership a requirement for employment. In recent years, lawmakers in Wash-ington have debated a proposed law that would prevent firms from hiring perma-nent replacements for workers who are on strike. This law would make strikesmore costly for firms and, thereby, would increase the market power of unions.These and similar policy decisions will help determine the future of the unionmovement.\\nARE UNIONS GOOD OR BAD FOR THE ECONOMY?\\nEconomists disagree about whether unions are good or bad for the economy as awhole. Let’s consider both sides of the debate.\\nCritics of unions argue that unions are merely a type of cartel. When unions\\nraise wages above the level that would prevail in competitive markets, they reducethe quantity of labor demanded, cause some workers to be unemployed, and re-duce the wages in the rest of the economy. The resulting allocation of labor is, crit-ics argue, both inefficient and inequitable. It is inefficient because high unionwages reduce employment in unionized firms below the efficient, competitivelevel. It is inequitable because some workers benefit at the expense of otherworkers.\\n“Gentlemen, nothing stands in the way of a final accord except that management \\nwants profit maximization and the union wants more moola.”CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 307\\nSOMEDAY YOU MAY FACE THE DECISION\\nabout whether to vote for or against a\\nunion in your workplace.

Do you trust theunion’s leaders? Do you want somebodyelse speaking for you in dealings withyour employer? Do you think you will bedismissed if you sign a union card—orthat the company will send your job over-seas if a union is organized?\\nBut in one regard, the choice is sim-\\nple—and it is not the choice that mostworkers have made during the labormovement’s recent decades in the eco-nomic wilderness.From a pocketbook perspective,\\nworkers are absolutely better off joininga union. Economists across the politicalspectrum agree. Turning a nonunion jobinto a union job very likely will have a big-ger effect on lifetime finances than all theadvice employees will ever read about in-vesting their 401(k) plans, buying ahome or otherwise making more of whatthey earn.\\nHere is how the equation works,\\nsaid Prof. Richard B. Freeman of HarvardUniversity: “For an existing worker in afirm, if you can carry out an organizingdrive, it is all to your benefit. If there aregoing to be losers, they are people whomight have gotten a job in the future, theshareholders whose profits will go down,the managers because there will be lessprofit to distribute to them in pay and,maybe, consumers will pay a little morefor the product. But as a worker, it is aw-fully hard to see why you wouldn’t want aunion.”\\nOverall, union workers are paid\\nabout 20 percent more than nonunionworkers, and their fringe benefits aretypically worth two to four times asmuch, economists with a wide array ofviews have found. The financial advan-tage is even greater for workers with lit-tle formal education and training and forwomen, blacks, and Hispanic workers.\\nMoreover, 85 percent of union\\nmembers have health insurance, com-pared with 57 percent of nonunionworkers, said Barry Bluestone, a labor-friendly economics professor at the Uni-versity of Massachusetts.\\nThe conclusion draws no argument\\neven from Prof. Leo Troy of Rutgers Uni-versity, who is widely known in academiccircles and among union leaders for hishostility to organized labor. “From astandpoint of wages and fringe bene-fits,” Professor Troy said, “the answer is\\nyes, you are better off in a union.”\\nHis objections to unions concern\\nhow they reduce profits for owners anddistort investment decisions in ways thatslow the overall growth of the econ-omy—not how they affect workers whobargain collectively. Professor Troypoints out that he belongs to a unionhimself—the American Association ofUniversity Professors.\\nDonald R. Deere, an economist at\\nthe Bush School of Government andPublic Service at Texas A & M University,studied the wage differential for compa-rable union and nonunion workers be-tween 1974 and 1996, a period whenunion membership fell to 15 percent ofAmerican workers from 22 percent.\\nIn every educational and age cate-\\ngory that he studied, Professor Deerefound that union members increasedtheir wage advantage over nonunionworkers during those years. Last year,he estimates, unionized workers withless than a high school education earned22 percent more than their nonunioncounterparts. The differential declined aseducation levels rose, reaching 10 per-cent for college graduates.\\n“It makes sense to belong to a\\nunion,” Professor Deere said, “so longas you don’t lose your job in the longterm.”\\nSource: The New York Times, Money & Business\\nSection, August 31, 1997, p. 1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nShould You Join a Union?308 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nAdvocates of unions contend that unions are a necessary antidote to the mar-\\nket power of the firms that hire workers. The extreme case of this market power isthe “company town,” where a single firm does most of the hiring in a geographicregion. In a company town, if workers do not accept the wages and working con-ditions that the firm offers, they have little choice but to move or stop working. Inthe absence of a union, therefore, the firm could use its market power to pay lowerwages and offer worse working conditions than would prevail if it had to com-pete with other firms for the same workers. In this case, a union may balance thefirm’s market power and protect the workers from being at the mercy of the firmowners.\\nAdvocates of unions also claim that unions are important for helping firms re-\\nspond efficiently to workers’ concerns. Whenever a worker takes a job, the workerand the firm must agree on many attributes of the job in addition to the wage:hours of work, overtime, vacations, sick leave, health benefits, promotion sched-ules, job security, and so on. By representing workers’ views on these issues,unions allow firms to provide the right mix of job attributes. Even if unions havethe adverse effect of pushing wages above the equilibrium level and causing un-employment, they have the benefit of helping firms keep a happy and productiveworkforce.\\nIn the end, there is no consensus among economists about whether unions are\\ngood or bad for the economy. Like many institutions, their influence is probablybeneficial in some circumstances and adverse in others.\\nQUICK QUIZ: How does a union in the auto industry affect wages and\\nemployment at General Motors and Ford? How does it affect wages andemployment in other industries?\\nTHE THEORY OF EFFICIENCY WAGES\\nA fourth reason why economies always experience some unemployment—in ad-dition to job search, minimum-wage laws, and unions—is suggested by the theoryof efficiency wages. According to this theory, firms operate more efficiently if\\nwages are above the equilibrium level. Therefore, it may be profitable for firms tokeep wages high even in the presence of a surplus of labor.\\nIn some ways, the unemployment that arises from efficiency wages is similar\\nto the unemployment that arises from minimum-wage laws and unions. In allthree cases, unemployment is the result of wages above the level that balances thequantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded. Yet there is alsoan important difference. Minimum-wage laws and unions prevent firms fromlowering wages in the presence of a surplus of workers. Efficiency-wage theorystates that such a constraint on firms is unnecessary in many cases because firmsmay be better off keeping wages above the equilibrium level.\\nWhy should firms want to keep wages high? In some ways, this decision\\nseems odd, for wages are a large part of firms’ costs. Normally, we expect profit-maximizing firms to want to keep costs—and therefore wages—as low as possible.efficiency wages\\nabove-equilibrium wages paidby firms in order to increaseworker productivityCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 309\\nThe novel insight of efficiency-wage theory is that paying high wages might be\\nprofitable because they might raise the efficiency of a firm’s workers.\\nThere are several types of efficiency-wage theory. Each type suggests a differ-\\nent explanation for why firms may want to pay high wages. Let’s now considerfour of these types.\\nWORKER HEALTH\\nThe first and simplest type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link betweenwages and worker health. Better paid workers eat a more nutritious diet, andworkers who eat a better diet are healthier and more productive. A firm may findit more profitable to pay high wages and have healthy, productive workers than topay lower wages and have less healthy, less productive workers.\\nThis type of efficiency-wage theory is not relevant for firms in rich countries\\nsuch as the United States. In these countries, the equilibrium wages for mostworkers are well above the level needed for an adequate diet. Firms are notconcerned that paying equilibrium wages would place their workers’ health injeopardy.\\nThis type of efficiency-wage theory is more relevant for firms in less devel-\\noped countries where inadequate nutrition is a more common problem. Unem-ployment is high in the cities of many poor African countries, for example. In thesecountries, firms may fear that cutting wages would, in fact, adversely influencetheir workers’ health and productivity. In other words, concern over nutrition mayexplain why firms do not cut wages despite a surplus of labor.\\nWORKER TURNOVER\\nA second type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages andworker turnover. Workers quit jobs for many reasons—to take jobs in other firms,to move to other parts of the country, to leave the labor force, and so on. The fre-quency with which they quit depends on the entire set of incentives they face, in-cluding the benefits of leaving and the benefits of staying. The more a firm pays itsworkers, the less often its workers will choose to leave. Thus, a firm can reduceturnover among its workers by paying them a high wage.\\nWhy do firms care about turnover? The reason is that it is costly for firms to\\nhire and train new workers. Moreover, even after they are trained, newly hiredworkers are not as productive as experienced workers. Firms with higherturnover, therefore, will tend to have higher production costs. Firms may find itprofitable to pay wages above the equilibrium level in order to reduce workerturnover.\\nWORKER EFFORT\\nA third type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wagesand worker effort. In many jobs, workers have some discretion over how hard towork. As a result, firms monitor the efforts of their workers, and workers caught310 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nshirking their responsibilities are fired. But not all shirkers are caught immediately\\nbecause monitoring workers is costly and imperfect. A firm can respond to thisproblem by paying wages above the equilibrium level. High wages make workersmore eager to keep their jobs and, thereby, give workers an incentive to put for-ward their best effort.\\nThis particular type of efficiency-wage theory is similar to the old Marxist idea\\nof the “reserve army of the unemployed.” Marx thought that employers benefitedfrom unemployment because the threat of unemployment helped to disciplinethose workers who had jobs. In the worker-effort variant of efficiency-wage theory,unemployment fills a similar role. If the wage were at the level that balanced sup-ply and demand, workers would have less reason to work hard because if theywere fired, they could quickly find new jobs at the same wage. Therefore, firmsraise wages above the equilibrium level, causing unemployment and providing anincentive for workers not to shirk their responsibilities.\\nWORKER QUALITY\\nA fourth and final type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link betweenwages and worker quality. When a firm hires new workers, it cannot perfectlygauge the quality of the applicants. By paying a high wage, the firm attracts a bet-ter pool of workers to apply for its jobs.\\nTo see how this might work, consider a simple example. Waterwell Company\\nowns one well and needs one worker to pump water from the well. Two workers,Bill and Ted, are interested in the job. Bill, a proficient worker, is willing to workfor $10 per hour. Below that wage, he would rather start his own lawn-mowingbusiness. Ted, a complete incompetent, is willing to work for anything above $2per hour. Below that wage, he would rather sit on the beach. Economists say thatBill’s reservation wage —the lowest wage he would accept—is $10, and Ted’s reser-\\nvation wage is $2.\\nWhat wage should the firm set? If the firm were interested in minimizing\\nlabor costs, it would set the wage at $2 per hour. At this wage, the quantity ofworkers supplied (one) would balance the quantity demanded. Ted would takethe job, and Bill would not apply for it. Yet suppose Waterwell knows that onlyone of these two applicants is competent, but it does not know whether it is Bill orTed. If the firm hires the incompetent worker, he will damage the well, causingthe firm huge losses. In this case, the firm has a better strategy than paying the\\nDILBERT®By Scott AdamsCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 311\\nequilibrium wage of $2 and hiring Ted. It can offer $10 per hour, inducing both Bill\\nand Ted to apply for the job. By choosing randomly between these two applicantsand turning the other away, the firm has a fifty-fifty chance of hiring the compe-tent one. By contrast, if the firm offers any lower wage, it is sure to hire the incom-petent worker.\\nIn many situations in life, in-\\nformation is asymmetric: Oneperson in a transaction knowsmore about what is going onthan the other person. Thispossibility raises a variety ofinteresting problems for eco-nomic theory. Some of theseproblems were highlighted inour description of the theory ofefficiency wages. These prob-lems, however, go beyond thestudy of unemployment.\\nThe worker-quality variant\\nof efficiency-wage theory illus-\\ntrates a general principle called adverse selection. Adverse\\nselection arises when one person knows more about the at-tributes of a good than another and, as a result, the unin-formed person runs the risk of being sold a good of lowquality. In the case of worker quality, for instance, workershave better information about their own abilities than firmsdo. When a firm cuts the wage it pays, the selection of work-ers changes in a way that is adverse to the firm.\\nAdverse selection arises in many other circumstances.\\nHere are two examples:\\nNSellers of used cars know their vehicles’ defects,\\nwhereas buyers often do not. Because owners of theworst cars are more likely to sell them than are theowners of the best cars, buyers are correctly apprehen-sive about getting a “lemon.” As a result, many peopleavoid buying cars in the used car market.\\nNBuyers of health insurance know more about their own\\nhealth problems than do insurance companies. Be-cause people with greater hidden health problems aremore likely to buy health insurance than are other peo-ple, the price of health insurance reflects the costs of asicker-than-average person. As a result, people with av-erage health problems are discouraged by the highprice from buying health insurance.\\nIn each case, the market for the product—used cars or\\nhealth insurance—does not work as well as it might be-cause of the problem of adverse selection.Similarly, the worker-effort variant of efficiency-wage\\ntheory illustrates a general phenomenon called moral haz-\\nard.Moral hazard arises when one person, called the agent,\\nis performing some task on behalf of another person, calledthe principal. Because the principal cannot perfectly monitor\\nthe agent’s behavior, the agent tends to undertake less ef-fort than the principal considers desirable. The term moral\\nhazard refers to the risk of dishonest or otherwise inappro-\\npriate behavior by the agent. In such a situation, the princi-pal tries various ways to encourage the agent to act moreresponsibly.\\nIn an employment relationship, the firm is the principal\\nand the worker is the agent. The moral-hazard problem isthe temptation of imperfectly monitored workers to shirktheir responsibilities. According to the worker-effort variantof efficiency-wage theory, the principal can encourage theagent not to shirk by paying a wage above the equilibriumlevel because then the agent has more to lose if caughtshirking. In this way, high wages reduce the problem ofmoral hazard.\\nMoral hazard arises in many other situations. Here are\\nsome examples:\\nNA homeowner with fire insurance buys too few fire ex-\\ntinguishers. The reason is that the homeowner bearsthe cost of the extinguisher while the insurance com-pany receives much of the benefit.\\nNA babysitter allows children to watch more television\\nthan the parents of the children prefer. The reason isthat more educational activities require more energyfrom the babysitter, even though they are beneficial forthe children.\\nNA family lives near a river with a high risk of flooding.\\nThe reason it continues to live there is that the familyenjoys the scenic views, and the government will bearpart of the cost when it provides disaster relief aftera flood.\\nCan you identify the principal and the agent in each of these\\nthree situations? How do you think the principal in eachcase might solve the problem of moral hazard?\\nFYI\\nThe Economics\\nof Asymmetric\\nInformation\\n312 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nCASE STUDY HENRY FORD AND THE VERY GENEROUS\\n$5-A-DAY WAGE\\nHenry Ford was an industrial visionary. As founder of the Ford Motor Com-\\npany, he was responsible for introducing modern techniques of production.Rather than building cars with small teams of skilled craftsmen, Ford built carson assembly lines in which unskilled workers were taught to perform the samesimple tasks over and over again. The output of this assembly process was theModel T Ford, one of the most famous early automobiles.\\nIn 1914, Ford introduced another innovation: the $5 workday. This might\\nnot seem like much today, but back then $5 was about twice the going wage. Itwas also far above the wage that balanced supply and demand. When the new$5-a-day wage was announced, long lines of job seekers formed outside theFord factories. The number of workers willing to work at this wage far ex-ceeded the number of workers Ford needed.\\nFord’s high-wage policy had many of the effects predicted by efficiency-\\nwage theory. Turnover fell, absenteeism fell, and productivity rose. Workerswere so much more efficient that Ford’s production costs were lower eventhough wages were higher. Thus, paying a wage above the equilibrium levelThis story illustrates a general phenomenon. When a firm faces a surplus of\\nworkers, it might seem profitable to reduce the wage it is offering. But by reducingthe wage, the firm induces an adverse change in the mix of workers. In this case,at a wage of $10, Waterwell has two workers applying for one job. But if Waterwellresponds to this labor surplus by reducing the wage, the competent worker (whohas better alternative opportunities) will not apply. Thus, it is profitable for thefirm to pay a wage above the level that balances supply and demand.\\nWORKERS OUTSIDE AN EARLY FORD FACTORY\\nCHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 313\\nwas profitable for the firm. Henry Ford himself called the $5-a-day wage “one\\nof the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.”\\nHistorical accounts of this episode are also consistent with efficiency-wage\\ntheory. An historian of the early Ford Motor Company wrote, “Ford and his as-sociates freely declared on many occasions that the high-wage policy turned outto be good business. By this they meant that it had improved the discipline ofthe workers, given them a more loyal interest in the institution, and raised theirpersonal efficiency.”\\nWhy did it take Henry Ford to introduce this efficiency wage? Why were\\nother firms not already taking advantage of this seemingly profitable businessstrategy? According to some analysts, Ford’s decision was closely linked to hisuse of the assembly line. Workers organized in an assembly line are highly in-terdependent. If one worker is absent or works slowly, other workers are lessable to complete their own tasks. Thus, while assembly lines made productionmore efficient, they also raised the importance of low worker turnover, highworker quality, and high worker effort. As a result, paying efficiency wagesmay have been a better strategy for the Ford Motor Company than for otherbusinesses at the time.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Give four explanations for why firms might find it\\nprofitable to pay wages above the level that balances quantity of laborsupplied and quantity of labor demanded.\\nCONCLUSION\\nIn this chapter we discussed the measurement of unemployment and the reasonswhy economies always experience some degree of unemployment. We have seenhow job search, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages can all help ex-plain why some workers do not have jobs. Which of these four explanations for thenatural rate of unemployment are the most important for the U.S. economy andother economies around the world? Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell.Economists differ in which of these explanations of unemployment they considermost important.\\nThe analysis of this chapter yields an important lesson: Although the economy\\nwill always have some unemployment, its natural rate is not immutable. Manyevents and policies can change the amount of unemployment the economy typi-cally experiences. As the information revolution changes the process of job search,as Congress adjusts the minimum wage, as workers form or quit unions, and asfirms alter their reliance on efficiency wages, the natural rate of unemploymentevolves. Unemployment is not a simple problem with a simple solution. But howwe choose to organize our society can profoundly influence how prevalent a prob-lem it is.314 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN\\nN The unemployment rate is the percentage of those who\\nwould like to work who do not have jobs. The Bureau ofLabor Statistics calculates this statistic monthly based ona survey of thousands of households.\\nN The unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of\\njoblessness. Some people who call themselvesunemployed may actually not want to work, and somepeople who would like to work have left the labor forceafter an unsuccessful search.\\nN In the U.S. economy, most people who become\\nunemployed find work within a short period of time.Nonetheless, most unemployment observed at anygiven time is attributable to the few people who areunemployed for long periods of time.\\nN One reason for unemployment is the time it takes for\\nworkers to search for jobs that best suit their tastes andskills. Unemployment insurance is a government policythat, while protecting workers’ incomes, increases theamount of frictional unemployment.N A second reason why our economy always has some\\nunemployment is minimum-wage laws. By raising thewage of unskilled and inexperienced workers above theequilibrium level, minimum-wage laws raise thequantity of labor supplied and reduce the quantitydemanded. The resulting surplus of labor representsunemployment.\\nN A third reason for unemployment is the market power\\nof unions. When unions push the wages in unionizedindustries above the equilibrium level, they create asurplus of labor.\\nN A fourth reason for unemployment is suggested by the\\ntheory of efficiency wages. According to this theory,firms find it profitable to pay wages above theequilibrium level. High wages can improve workerhealth, lower worker turnover, increase worker effort,and raise worker quality.\\nSummary\\nlabor force, p. 293\\nunemployment rate, p. 294labor-force participation rate, p. 294natural rate of unemployment, p. 294cyclical unemployment, p. 295discouraged workers, p. 298\\nfrictional unemployment, p. 299structural unemployment, p. 299job search, p. 299unemployment insurance, p. 301union, p. 304\\ncollective bargaining, p. 305strike, p. 305efficiency wages, p. 308\\nKey Concepts\\n1.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that in\\nDecember 1998, of all adult Americans, 138,547,000 wereemployed, 6,021,000 were unemployed, and 67,723,000were not in the labor force. How big was the laborforce? What was the labor-force participation rate?What was the unemployment rate?\\n2. As shown in Figure 14-3, the overall labor-force\\nparticipation rate of men declined between 1970 and1990.

Between 1997 and 1998, total U.S. employment\\nincreased by 2.1 million workers, but the number ofunemployed workers declined by only 0.5 million.How are these numbers consistent with each other?Why might one expect a reduction in the number ofpeople counted as unemployed to be smaller than theincrease in the number of people employed?\\n5. Are the following workers more likely to experience\\nshort-term or long-term unemployment?

What happened to the elasticity of demand for\\nAmerican cars when the Japanese developeda strong auto industry? What happened to theelasticity of demand for American autoworkers?Explain.\\nb. As the chapter explains, a union generally faces\\na tradeoff in deciding how much to raise wages,because a bigger increase is better for workerswho remain employed but also results in a greaterreduction in employment.

Some workers in the economy are paid a flat salary and\\nsome are paid by commission. Which compensationscheme would require more monitoring by supervisors?In which case do firms have an incentive to pay morethan the equilibrium level (as in the worker-effortvariant of efficiency-wage theory)? What factors do youthink determine the type of compensation firms choose?\\n11. Each of the following situations involves moral hazard.\\nIn each case, identify the principal and the agent, andexplain why there is asymmetric information. How doesthe action described reduce the problem of moralhazard?a. Landlords require tenants to pay security deposits.b.

Car insurance companies offer discounts to\\ncustomers who install antitheft devices in their cars.\\n12. Suppose that the Live-Long-and-Prosper Health\\nInsurance Company charges $5,000 annually for afamily insurance policy. The company’s presidentsuggests that the company raise the annual price to$6,000 in order to increase its profits. If the firmfollowed this suggestion, what economic problem mightarise? Would the firm’s pool of customers tend to\\nbecome more or less healthy on average? Would thecompany’s profits necessarily increase?\\n13. (This problem is challenging.) Suppose that Congress\\npasses a law requiring employers to provide employeessome benefit (such as health care) that raises the cost ofan employee by $4 per hour.a. What effect does this employer mandate have on\\nthe demand for labor? (In answering this and thefollowing questions, be quantitative when you can.)\\nb.

To pay for this service, you might hand the restaurateur several worn-outpieces of greenish paper decorated with strange symbols, government buildings,and the portraits of famous dead Americans. Or you might hand him a singlepiece of paper with the name of a bank and your signature. Whether you pay bycash or check, the restaurateur is happy to work hard to satisfy your gastronomi-cal desires in exchange for these pieces of paper which, in and of themselves, areworthless.\\nTo anyone who has lived in a modern economy, this social custom is not at all\\nodd. Even though paper money has no intrinsic value, the restaurateur is confi-dent that, in the future, some third person will accept it in exchange for somethingthat the restaurateur does value. And that third person is confident that somefourth person will accept the money, with the knowledge that yet a fifth personwill accept the money . . . and so on. To the restaurateur and to other people in oursociety, your cash or check represents a claim to goods and services in the future.THE MONETARY SYSTEM\\n320 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nThe social custom of using money for transactions is extraordinarily useful in\\na large, complex society. Imagine, for a moment, that there was no item in theeconomy widely accepted in exchange for goods and services. People would haveto rely on barter —the exchange of one good or service for another—to obtain the\\nthings they need. To get your restaurant meal, for instance, you would have tooffer the restaurateur something of immediate value. You could offer to washsome dishes, clean his car, or give him your family’s secret recipe for meat loaf. Aneconomy that relies on barter will have trouble allocating its scarce resourcesefficiently. In such an economy, trade is said to require the double coincidence of\\nwants —the unlikely occurrence that two people each have a good or service that\\nthe other wants.\\nThe existence of money makes trade easier. The restaurateur does not care\\nwhether you can produce a valuable good or service for him. He is happy to acceptyour money, knowing that other people will do the same for him. Such a conven-tion allows trade to be roundabout. The restaurateur accepts your money and usesit to pay his chef; the chef uses her paycheck to send her child to day care; the daycare center uses this tuition to pay a teacher; and the teacher hires you to mow hislawn. As money flows from person to person in the economy, it facilitates produc-tion and trade, thereby allowing each person to specialize in what he or she doesbest and raising everyone’s standard of living.\\nIn this chapter we begin to examine the role of money in the economy. We dis-\\ncuss what money is, the various forms that money takes, how the banking systemhelps create money, and how the government controls the quantity of money incirculation. Because money is so important in the economy, we devote much effortin the rest of this book to learning how changes in the quantity of money affectvarious economic variables, including inflation, interest rates, production, and em-ployment. Consistent with our long-run focus in the previous three chapters, in thenext chapter we will examine the long-run effects of changes in the quantity ofmoney. The short-run effects of monetary changes are a more complex topic, whichwe will take up later in the book. This chapter provides the background for all ofthis further analysis.\\nTHE MEANING OF MONEY\\nWhat is money? This might seem like an odd question. When you read that bil-lionaire Bill Gates has a lot of money, you know what that means: He is so rich thathe can buy almost anything he wants. In this sense, the term money is used to mean\\nwealth.\\nEconomists, however, use the word in a more specific sense: Money is the set\\nof assets in the economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services fromother people. The cash in your wallet is money because you can use it to buy ameal at a restaurant or a shirt at a clothing store. By contrast, if you happened toown most of Microsoft Corporation, as Bill Gates does, you would be wealthy, butthis asset is not considered a form of money. You could not buy a meal or a shirtwith this wealth without first obtaining some cash. According to the economist’sdefinition, money includes only those few types of wealth that are regularlyaccepted by sellers in exchange for goods and services. money\\nthe set of assets in an economy thatpeople regularly use to buy goodsand services from other peopleCHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 321\\nTHE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY\\nMoney has three functions in the economy: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of ac-\\ncount, and a store of value. These three functions together distinguish money from\\nother assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and even baseball cards. Let’sexamine each of these functions of money in turn.\\nAmedium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers when they pur-\\nchase goods and services. When you buy a shirt at a clothing store, the store givesyou the shirt, and you give the store your money. This transfer of money frombuyer to seller allows the transaction to take place. When you walk into a store,you are confident that the store will accept your money for the items it is sellingbecause money is the commonly accepted medium of exchange.\\nAunit of account is the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts.\\nWhen you go shopping, you might observe that a shirt costs $20 and a hamburgercosts $2. Even though it would be accurate to say that the price of a shirt is 10 ham-burgers and the price of a hamburger is 1/10 of a shirt, prices are never quoted inthis way. Similarly, if you take out a loan from a bank, the size of your future loanrepayments will be measured in dollars, not in a quantity of goods and services.When we want to measure and record economic value, we use money as the unitof account.\\nAstore of value is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power\\nfrom the present to the future. When a seller accepts money today in exchange fora good or service, that seller can hold the money and become a buyer of anothergood or service at another time. Of course, money is not the only store of value inthe economy, for a person can also transfer purchasing power from the present tothe future by holding other assets. The term wealth is used to refer to the total of all\\nstores of value, including both money and nonmonetary assets.\\nEconomists use the term liquidity to describe the ease with which an asset can\\nbe converted into the economy’s medium of exchange. Because money is the econ-omy’s medium of exchange, it is the most liquid asset available. Other assets varywidely in their liquidity. Most stocks and bonds can be sold easily with small cost,so they are relatively liquid assets. By contrast, selling a house, a Rembrandt paint-ing, or a 1948 Joe DiMaggio baseball card requires more time and effort, so theseassets are less liquid.\\nWhen people decide in what form to hold their wealth, they have to balance\\nthe liquidity of each possible asset against the asset’s usefulness as a store of value.Money is the most liquid asset, but it is far from perfect as a store of value. Whenprices rise, the value of money falls. In other words, when goods and services be-come more expensive, each dollar in your wallet can buy less. This link betweenthe price level and the value of money will turn out to be important for under-standing how money affects the economy.\\nTHE KINDS OF MONEY\\nWhen money takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value, it is called com-\\nmodity money. The term intrinsic value means that the item would have value\\neven if it were not used as money. One example of commodity money is gold.Gold has intrinsic value because it is used in industry and in the making of jewelry.Although today we no longer use gold as money, historically gold has been acommon form of money because it is relatively easy to carry, measure, and verifymedium of exchange\\nan item that buyers give to sellerswhen they want to purchase goodsand services\\nunit of account\\nthe yardstick people use to postprices and record debts\\nstore of value\\nan item that people can use totransfer purchasing power from thepresent to the future\\nliquidity\\nthe ease with which an asset can beconverted into the economy’smedium of exchange\\ncommodity money\\nmoney that takes the form of acommodity with intrinsic valuefor impurities. When an economy uses gold as money (or uses paper money that\\nis convertible into gold on demand), it is said to be operating under a gold standard.322 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nTHE ROLE OF SOCIAL CUSTOM IN THE MON -\\netary system is most apparent in for-eign cultures with customs verydifferent from our own. The followingarticle describes the money on the is-land of Yap. As you read the article, askyourself whether Yap is using a type ofcommodity money, a type of fiatmoney, or something in between.\\nFixed Assets, or Why a Loan\\nin Yap Is Hard to Roll Over\\nBYARTPINE\\nYAP, MICRONESIA —On this tiny South Pa-\\ncific island, life is easy and the currencyis hard.\\nElsewhere, the world’s troubled\\nmonetary system creaks along; floatingexchange rates wreak havoc on currencymarkets, and devaluations are common-place. But on Yap the currency is assolid as a rock. In fact, it \\nisrock. Lime-\\nstone to be precise.\\nFor nearly 2,000 years the Yapese\\nhave used large stone wheels to pay formajor purchases, such as land, canoesand permissions to marry. Yap is a U.S.trust territory, and the dollar is used ingrocery stores and gas stations. But re-liance on stone money, like the island’sancient caste system and the traditional\\ndress of loincloths and grass skirts,continues.\\nBuying property with stones is\\n“much easier than buying it with U.S.dollars,” says John Chodad, who re-cently purchased a building lot with a 30-inch stone wheel. “We don’t know thevalue of the U.S. dollar.” . . .\\nStone wheels don’t make good\\npocket money, so for small transactions,Yapese use other forms of currency,such as beer. Beer is proffered as pay-ment for all sorts of odd jobs, includingconstruction. The 10,000 people on Yapconsume 40,000 to 50,000 cases ayear, mostly of Budweiser. . . .\\nThe people of Yap have been using\\nstone money ever since a Yapese war-rior named Anagumang first brought thehuge stones from limestone caverns onneighboring Palau, some 1,500 to 2,000years ago. Inspired by the moon, hefashioned the stone into large circles.The rest is history.\\nYapese lean the stone wheels\\nagainst their houses or prop up rows ofthem in village “banks.” Most of thestones are 2 1/2 to 5 feet in diameter,but some are as much as 12 feet across.Each has a hole in the center so it can beslipped onto the trunk of a fallen betelnut tree and carried. It takes 20 men tolift some stones.\\nBy custom, the stones are worth-\\nless when broken. You never hear peo-ple on Yap musing about wanting a pieceof the rock. Rather than risk a brokenstone—or back—Yapese tend to leavethe larger stones where they are andmake a mental accounting that the own-ership has been transferred—much asgold bars used in international transac-\\ntions change hands without leaving thevaults of the New York Federal ReserveBank. . . .\\nThere are some decided advan-\\ntages to using massive stones formoney. They are immune to black-market trading, for one thing, and theypose formidable obstacles to pick-pockets. In addition, there aren’t anysterile debates about how to stabilize theYapese monetary system. With only6,600 stone wheels remaining on theisland, the money supply stays put. . . .\\nMeanwhile, Yap’s stone money may\\nbe about to take on international signifi-cance. Just yesterday, Washington re-ceived notice that Tosiho Nakayama, thepresident of Micronesia, plans to bring astone disk when he visits the UnitedStates next month. It will be flown by AirForce jet.\\nOfficials say Mr. Nakayama intends\\nthe stone as Micronesia’s symbolic con-tribution toward reducing the U.S. bud-get deficit.\\nSOURCE :The Wall Street Journal, March 29, 1984,\\np. A1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nMoney on the Island of Yap\\nMONEY ON THE ISLAND OF YAP: NOT EXACTLY\\nPOCKET CHANGECHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 323\\nAnother example of commodity money is cigarettes. In prisoner-of-war camps\\nduring World War II, prisoners traded goods and services with one another usingcigarettes as the store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange. Simi-larly, as the Soviet Union was breaking up in the late 1980s, cigarettes started re-placing the ruble as the preferred currency in Moscow. In both cases, evennonsmokers were happy to accept cigarettes in an exchange, knowing that theycould use the cigarettes to buy other goods and services.\\nMoney without intrinsic value is called fiat money. Afiatis simply an order or\\ndecree, and fiat money is established as money by government decree. For exam-ple, compare the paper dollars in your wallet (printed by the U.S. government)and the paper dollars from a game of Monopoly (printed by the Parker Brothersgame company). Why can you use the first to pay your bill at a restaurant but notthe second? The answer is that the U.S. government has decreed its dollars to bevalid money. Each paper dollar in your wallet reads: “This note is legal tender forall debts, public and private.”\\nAlthough the government is central to establishing and regulating a system of\\nfiat money (by prosecuting counterfeiters, for example), other factors are also re-quired for the success of such a monetary system. To a large extent, the acceptanceof fiat money depends as much on expectations and social convention as on gov-ernment decree. The Soviet government in the 1980s never abandoned the ruble asthe official currency. Yet the people of Moscow preferred to accept cigarettes (oreven American dollars) in exchange for goods and services, because they weremore confident that these alternative monies would be accepted by others in thefuture.\\nMONEY IN THE U.S. ECONOMY\\nAs we will see, the quantity of money circulating in the economy, called the money\\nstock, has a powerful influence on many economic variables. But before we con-\\nsider why that is true, we need to ask a preliminary question: What is the quantityof money? In particular, suppose you were given the task of measuring how muchmoney there is in the U.S. economy. What would you include in your measure?\\nThe most obvious asset to include is currency —the paper bills and coins in the\\nhands of the public. Currency is clearly the most widely accepted medium of ex-change in our economy. There is no doubt that it is part of the money stock.\\nYet currency is not the only asset that you can use to buy goods and services.\\nMany stores also accept personal checks. Wealth held in your checking account isalmost as convenient for buying things as wealth held in your wallet. To mea-sure the money stock, therefore, you might want to include demand deposits —\\nbalances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand simply by writinga check.\\nOnce you start to consider balances in checking accounts as part of the money\\nstock, you are led to consider the large variety of other accounts that people holdat banks and other financial institutions. Bank depositors usually cannot writechecks against the balances in their savings accounts, but they can easily transferfunds from savings into checking accounts. In addition, depositors in money mar-ket mutual funds can often write checks against their balances. Thus, these otheraccounts should plausibly be part of the U.S. money stock.fiat money\\nmoney without intrinsic valuethat is used as money becauseof government decree\\ncurrency\\nthe paper bills and coins in thehands of the public\\ndemand deposits\\nbalances in bank accounts thatdepositors can access on demandby writing a check“Gee, these new twenties lookjust like Monopoly money.”\\n324 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nCASE STUDY WHERE IS ALL THE CURRENCY?\\nOne puzzle about the money stock of the U.S. economy concerns the amount of\\ncurrency. In 1998 there was about $460 billion of currency outstanding. To putthis number in perspective, we can divide it by 205 million, the number ofadults (age sixteen and over) in the United States. This calculation implies thatthe average adult holds about $2,240 of currency. Most people are surprised tolearn that our economy has so much currency because they carry far less thanthis in their wallets.\\nWho is holding all this currency? No one knows for sure, but there are two\\nplausible explanations.\\nThe first explanation is that much of the currency is being held abroad. In\\nforeign countries without a stable monetary system, people often prefer U.S.dollars to domestic assets. It is, in fact, not unusual to see U.S. dollars beingused overseas as the medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.\\nThe second explanation is that much of the currency is being held by drug\\ndealers, tax evaders, and other criminals. For most people in the U.S. economy,In a complex economy such as ours, it is not easy to draw a line between assets\\nthat can be called “money” and assets that cannot. The coins in your pocket areclearly part of the money stock, and the Empire State Building clearly is not, butthere are many assets in between these extremes for which the choice is less clear.Therefore, various measures of the money stock are available for the U.S. economy.Table 15-1 shows the two most important, designated M1 and M2. Each of thesemeasures uses a slightly different criterion for distinguishing monetary and non-monetary assets.\\nFor our purposes in this book, we need not dwell on the differences between\\nthe various measures of money. The important point is that the money stock for theU.S. economy includes not just currency but also deposits in banks and other finan-cial institutions that can be readily accessed and used to buy goods and services.Table 15-1\\nTWOMEASURES OF THE MONEY\\nSTOCK FOR THE U.S. E CONOMY .\\nThe two most widely followedmeasures of the money stockare M1 and M2.MEASURE AMOUNT IN 1998 W HAT’SINCLUDED\\nM1 $1,092 billion Currency\\nTraveler’s checksDemand depositsOther checkable deposits\\nM2 $4,412 billion Everything in M1\\nSavings depositsSmall time depositsMoney market mutual funds\\nA few minor categories\\nSOURCE : Federal Reserve.CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 325\\ncurrency is not a particularly good way to hold wealth. Not only can currency\\nbe lost or stolen, but it also does not earn interest, whereas a bank deposit does.Thus, most people hold only small amounts of currency. By contrast, criminalsmay avoid putting their wealth in banks, because a bank deposit gives police apaper trail with which to trace their illegal activities. For criminals, currencymay be the best store of value available.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and describe the three functions of money.\\nTHE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM\\nWhenever an economy relies on a system of fiat money, as the U.S. economy does,\\nsome agency must be responsible for regulating the system. In the United States,that agency is the Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed. If you look at the\\ntop of a dollar bill, you will see that it is called a “Federal Reserve Note.” The Fedis an example of a central bank —an institution designed to oversee the banking\\nsystem and regulate the quantity of money in the economy. Other major central\\nIt might seem natural to in-\\nclude credit cards as part ofthe economy’s stock of money.After all, people use creditcards to make many oftheir purchases. Aren’t creditcards, therefore, a medium ofexchange?\\nAlthough at first this argu-\\nment may seem persuasive,credit cards are excluded fromall measures of the quantity ofmoney. The reason is thatcredit cards are not really a\\nmethod of payment but a method of deferring payment.\\nWhen you buy a meal with a credit card, the bank that is-sued the card pays the restaurant what it is due. At a laterdate, you will have to repay the bank (perhaps with interest).When the time comes to pay your credit card bill, you willprobably do so by writing a check against your checking ac-count. The balance in this checking account is part of theeconomy’s stock of money.\\nNotice that credit cards are very different from debit\\ncards, which automatically withdraw funds from a bankaccount to pay for\\nitems bought. Ratherthan allowing the userto postpone paymentfor a purchase, adebit card allows theuser immediate ac-cess to deposits in abank account. In thissense, a debit card ismore similar to acheck than to a creditcard. The account balances that lie behind debit cards areincluded in measures of the quantity of money.\\nEven though credit cards are not considered a form of\\nmoney, they are nonetheless important for analyzing themonetary system. People who have credit cards can paymany of their bills all at once at the end of the month, ratherthan sporadically as they make purchases. As a result, peo-ple who have credit cards probably hold less money onaverage than people who do not have credit cards. Thus, theintroduction and increased popularity of credit cards mayreduce the amount of money that people choose to hold.\\nIS THIS MONEY ?\\nFederal Reserve (Fed)\\nthe central bank of the United StatesFYI\\nCredit Cards,\\nDebit Cards,\\nand Money\\ncentral bank\\nan institution designed to overseethe banking system and regulate thequantity of money in the economy\\n326 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nbanks around the world include the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the\\nEuropean Central Bank.\\nTHE FED’S ORGANIZATION\\nThe Federal Reserve was created in 1914, after a series of bank failures in 1907 con-vinced Congress that the United States needed a central bank to ensure the healthof the nation’s banking system. Today, the Fed is run by its Board of Governors,which has seven members appointed by the president of the United States andconfirmed by the Senate. The governors have 14-year terms. Just as federal judgesare given lifetime appointments to insulate them from politics, Fed governors aregiven long terms to give them independence from short-term political pressureswhen they formulate monetary policy.\\nAmong the seven members of the Board of Governors, the most important is\\nthe chairman. The chairman directs the Fed staff, presides over board meetings,and testifies regularly about Fed policy in front of congressional committees. Thepresident appoints the chairman to a four-year term. As this book was going topress, the chairman of the Fed was Alan Greenspan, who was originally appointedin 1987 by President Reagan and later reappointed by Presidents Bush andClinton.\\nThe Federal Reserve System is made up of the Federal Reserve Board in Wash-\\nington, D.C., and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities aroundthe country. The presidents of the regional banks are chosen by each bank’s boardof directors, whose members are typically drawn from the region’s banking andbusiness community.\\nThe Fed has two related jobs. The first job is to regulate banks and ensure the\\nhealth of the banking system. This task is largely the responsibility of the regionalFederal Reserve Banks. In particular, the Fed monitors each bank’s financial con-dition and facilitates bank transactions by clearing checks. It also acts as a bank’sbank. That is, the Fed makes loans to banks when banks themselves want to bor-row. When financially troubled banks find themselves short of cash, the Fed actsas a lender of last resort —a lender to those who cannot borrow anywhere else—in\\norder to maintain stability in the overall banking system.\\nThe Fed’s second and more important job is to control the quantity of money\\nthat is made available in the economy, called the money supply. Decisions by\\npolicymakers concerning the money supply constitute monetary policy. At the\\nFederal Reserve, monetary policy is made by the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC). The FOMC meets about every six weeks in Washington, D.C., to discussthe condition of the economy and consider changes in monetary policy.\\nTHE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee is made up of the seven members of theBoard of Governors and five of the 12 regional bank presidents. All 12 regionalpresidents attend each FOMC meeting, but only five get to vote. The five with vot-ing rights rotate among the 12 regional presidents over time. The president of theNew York Fed always gets a vote, however, because New York is the traditionalmoney supply\\nthe quantity of money availablein the economy\\nmonetary policy\\nthe setting of the money supply bypolicymakers in the central bankCHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 327\\nfinancial center of the U.S. economy and because all Fed purchases and sales of\\ngovernment bonds are conducted at the New York Fed’s trading desk.\\nThrough the decisions of the FOMC, the Fed has the power to increase or de-\\ncrease the number of dollars in the economy. In simple metaphorical terms, youcan imagine the Fed printing up dollar bills and dropping them around the coun-try by helicopter. Similarly, you can imagine the Fed using a giant vacuum cleanerto suck dollar bills out of people’s wallets. Although in practice the Fed’s methodsfor changing the money supply are more complex and subtle than this, thehelicopter-vacuum metaphor is a good first approximation to the meaning ofmonetary policy.\\nWe discuss later in this chapter how the Fed actually changes the money sup-\\nply, but it is worth noting here that the Fed’s primary tool is open-market opera-\\ntions —the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds. (Recall that a U.S.\\ngovernment bond is a certificate of indebtedness of the federal government.) If theFOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and usesthem to buy government bonds from the public in the nation’s bond markets.After the purchase, these dollars are in the hands of the public. Thus, an open-market purchase of bonds by the Fed increases the money supply. Conversely, ifthe FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bondsfrom its portfolio to the public in the nation’s bond markets. After the sale, the dol-lars it receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public. Thus, an open-market sale of bonds by the Fed decreases the money supply.\\nThe Fed is an important institution because changes in the money supply can\\nprofoundly affect the economy. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1\\nis that prices rise when the government prints too much money. Another of theTen Principles of Economics is that society faces a short-run tradeoff between infla-\\ntion and unemployment. The power of the FOMC rests on these principles. Forreasons we discuss more fully in the coming chapters, the FOMC’s policy deci-sions have an important influence on the economy’s rate of inflation in the longrun and the economy’s employment and production in the short run. Indeed, thechairman of the Federal Reserve has been called the second most powerful personin the United States.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What are the primary responsibilities of the Federal\\nReserve? If the Fed wants to increase the supply of money, how does itusually do it?\\nBANKS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY\\nSo far we have introduced the concept of “money” and discussed how the FederalReserve controls the supply of money by buying and selling government bonds inopen-market operations. Although this explanation of the money supply is correct,it is not complete. In particular, it omits the central role that banks play in the mon-etary system.\\n328 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nRecall that the amount of money you hold includes both currency (the bills in\\nyour wallet and coins in your pocket) and demand deposits (the balance in yourchecking account). Because demand deposits are held in banks, the behavior ofbanks can influence the quantity of demand deposits in the economy and, there-fore, the money supply. This section examines how banks affect the money supplyand how they complicate the Fed’s job of controlling the money supply.\\nTHE SIMPLE CASE OF 100-PERCENT-RESERVE BANKING\\nTo see how banks influence the money supply, it is useful to imagine first a worldwithout any banks at all. In this simple world, currency is the only form of money.To be concrete, let’s suppose that the total quantity of currency is $100. The supplyof money is, therefore, $100.\\nNow suppose that someone opens a bank, appropriately called First National\\nBank. First National Bank is only a depository institution—that is, it accepts de-posits but does not make loans. The purpose of the bank is to give depositors asafe place to keep their money. Whenever a person deposits some money, the bankkeeps the money in its vault until the depositor comes to withdraw it or writes acheck against his or her balance. Deposits that banks have received but have notloaned out are called reserves. In this imaginary economy, all deposits are held as\\nreserves, so this system is called 100-percent-reserve banking.\\nWe can express the financial position of First National Bank with a T-account,\\nwhich is a simplified accounting statement that shows changes in a bank’s assetsand liabilities. Here is the T-account for First National Bank if the economy’s entire$100 of money is deposited in the bank:\\nFIRST NATIONAL BANK\\nASSETS LIABILITIES\\nReserves $100.00 Deposits $100.00\\n”I’ve heard a lot about money, and now I’d like to try some.”\\nreserves\\ndeposits that banks have received buthave not loaned outCHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 329\\nOn the left-hand side of the T-account are the bank’s assets of $100 (the reserves it\\nholds in its vaults). On the right-hand side of the T-account are the bank’s liabili-ties of $100 (the amount it owes to its depositors). Notice that the assets and liabil-ities of First National Bank exactly balance.\\nNow consider the money supply in this imaginary economy. Before First Na-\\ntional Bank opens, the money supply is the $100 of currency that people are hold-ing. After the bank opens and people deposit their currency, the money supply isthe $100 of demand deposits. (There is no longer any currency outstanding, for itis all in the bank vault.) Each deposit in the bank reduces currency and raises de-mand deposits by exactly the same amount, leaving the money supply unchanged.Thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money.\\nMONEY CREATION WITH FRACTIONAL-RESERVE BANKING\\nEventually, the bankers at First National Bank may start to reconsider their policy\\nof 100-percent-reserve banking. Leaving all that money sitting idle in their vaultsseems unnecessary. Why not use some of it to make loans? Families buyinghouses, firms building new factories, and students paying for college would all behappy to pay interest to borrow some of that money for a while. Of course, FirstNational Bank has to keep some reserves so that currency is available if depositorswant to make withdrawals. But if the flow of new deposits is roughly the same asthe flow of withdrawals, First National needs to keep only a fraction of its depositsin reserve. Thus, First National adopts a system called fractional-reserve banking.\\nThe fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves is called the reserve\\nratio. This ratio is determined by a combination of government regulation and\\nbank policy. As we discuss more fully later in the chapter, the Fed places a mini-mum on the amount of reserves that banks hold, called a reserve requirement. In ad-\\ndition, banks may hold reserves above the legal minimum, called excess reserves, so\\nthey can be more confident that they will not run short of cash. For our purposehere, we just take reserve ratio as given and examine what fractional-reserve bank-ing means for the money supply.\\nLet’s suppose that First National has a reserve ratio of 10 percent. This means\\nthat it keeps 10 percent of its deposits in reserve and loans out the rest. Now let’slook again at the bank’s T-account:\\nFIRST NATIONAL BANK\\nASSETS LIABILITIES\\nReserves $10.00 Deposits $100.00\\nLoans 90.00\\nFirst National still has $100 in liabilities because making the loans did not alter the\\nbank’s obligation to its depositors. But now the bank has two kinds of assets: It has$10 of reserves in its vault, and it has loans of $90. (These loans are liabilities of thepeople taking out the loans but they are assets of the bank making the loans, be-cause the borrowers will later repay the bank.) In total, First National’s assets stillequal its liabilities.\\nOnce again consider the supply of money in the economy. Before First\\nNational makes any loans, the money supply is the $100 of deposits in the bank.fractional-reserve banking\\na banking system in which bankshold only a fraction of depositsas reserves\\nreserve ratio\\nthe fraction of deposits thatbanks hold as reserves330 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nYet when First National makes these loans, the money supply increases. The\\ndepositors still have demand deposits totaling $100, but now the borrowers hold$90 in currency. The money supply (which equals currency plus demand deposits)equals $190. Thus, when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, banks create\\nmoney.\\nAt first, this creation of money by fractional-reserve banking may seem too\\ngood to be true because it appears that the bank has created money out of thin air.To make this creation of money seem less miraculous, note that when First Na-tional Bank loans out some of its reserves and creates money, it does not create anywealth. Loans from First National give the borrowers some currency and thus theability to buy goods and services. Yet the borrowers are also taking on debts, sothe loans do not make them any richer. In other words, as a bank creates the as-set of money, it also creates a corresponding liability for its borrowers. At the endof this process of money creation, the economy is more liquid in the sense thatthere is more of the medium of exchange, but the economy is no wealthier thanbefore.\\nTHE MONEY MULTIPLIER\\nThe creation of money does not stop with First National Bank. Suppose the bor-rower from First National uses the $90 to buy something from someone who thendeposits the currency in Second National Bank. Here is the T-account for SecondNational Bank:\\nSECOND NATIONAL BANK\\nASSETS LIABILITIES\\nReserves $ 9.00 Deposits $90.00\\nLoans 81.00\\nAfter the deposit, this bank has liabilities of $90. If Second National also has a re-\\nserve ratio of 10 percent, it keeps assets of $9 in reserve and makes $81 in loans.In this way, Second National Bank creates an additional $81 of money. If this $81is eventually deposited in Third National Bank, which also has a reserve ratio of10 percent, this bank keeps $8.10 in reserve and makes $72.90 in loans. Here is theT-account for Third National Bank:\\nTHIRD NATIONAL BANK\\nASSETS LIABILITIES\\nReserves $ 8.10 Deposits $81.00\\nLoans 72.90\\nThe process goes on and on. Each time that money is deposited and a bank loan is\\nmade, more money is created.CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 331\\nHow much money is eventually created in this economy? Let’s add it up:\\nOriginal deposit /H11005$ 100.00\\nFirst National lending /H11005$ 90.00 [ /H11005.9 /H11003$100.00]\\nSecond National lending /H11005$ 81.00 [ /H11005.9 /H11003$90.00]\\nThird National lending /H11005$ 72.90 [ /H11005.9 /H11003$81.00]\\n••••••\\nTotal money supply /H11005$1,000.00\\nIt turns out that even though this process of money creation can continue forever,\\nit does not create an infinite amount of money. If you laboriously add the infinitesequence of numbers in the foregoing example, you find the $100 of reserves gen-erates $1,000 of money. The amount of money the banking system generates witheach dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier. In this imaginary economy,\\nwhere the $100 of reserves generates $1,000 of money, the money multiplier is 10.\\nWhat determines the size of the money multiplier? It turns out that the answer\\nis simple: The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. If Ris the reserve\\nratio for all banks in the economy, then each dollar of reserves generates 1/ Rdol-\\nlars of money. In our example, R/H110051/10, so the money multiplier is 10.\\nThis reciprocal formula for the money multiplier makes sense. If a bank holds\\n$1,000 in deposits, then a reserve ratio of 1/10 (10 percent) means that the bankmust hold $100 in reserves. The money multiplier just turns this idea around: If thebanking system as a whole holds a total of $100 in reserves, it can have only $1,000in deposits. In other words, if Ris the ratio of reserves to deposits at each bank\\n(that is, the reserve ratio), then the ratio of deposits to reserves in the banking sys-tem (that is, the money multiplier) must be 1/ R.\\nThis formula shows how the amount of money banks create depends on the\\nreserve ratio. If the reserve ratio were only 1/20 (5 percent), then the banking sys-tem would have 20 times as much in deposits as in reserves, implying a moneymultiplier of 20. Each dollar of reserves would generate $20 of money. Similarly, ifthe reserve ratio were 1/5 (20 percent), deposits would be 5 times reserves, themoney multiplier would be 5, and each dollar of reserves would generate $5 ofmoney. Thus, the higher the reserve ratio, the less of each deposit banks loan out, and the\\nsmaller the money multiplier. In the special case of 100-percent-reserve banking, the\\nreserve ratio is 1, the money multiplier is 1, and banks do not make loans or createmoney.\\nTHE FED’S TOOLS OF MONETARY CONTROL\\nAs we have already discussed, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controllingthe supply of money in the economy. Now that we understand how fractional-reserve banking works, we are in a better position to understand how the Fed car-ries out this job. Because banks create money in a system of fractional-reservebanking, the Fed’s control of the money supply is indirect. When the Fed decidesto change the money supply, it must consider how its actions will work throughthe banking system.\\nThe Fed has three tools in its monetary toolbox: open-market operations,\\nreserve requirements, and the discount rate. Let’s discuss how the Fed uses each ofthese tools.money multiplier\\nthe amount of money thebanking system generateswith each dollar of reserves332 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nOpen-Market Operations As we noted earlier, the Fed conducts open-\\nmarket operations when it buys or sells government bonds from the public. To in-\\ncrease the money supply, the Fed instructs its bond traders at the New York Fed tobuy bonds in the nation’s bond markets. The dollars the Fed pays for the bonds in-crease the number of dollars in circulation. Some of these new dollars are held ascurrency, and some are deposited in banks. Each new dollar held as currency in-creases the money supply by exactly $1. Each new dollar deposited in a bank in-creases the money supply to an even greater extent because it increases reservesand, thereby, the amount of money that the banking system can create.\\nTo reduce the money supply, the Fed does just the opposite: It sells govern-\\nment bonds to the public in the nation’s bond markets. The public pays for thesebonds with its holdings of currency and bank deposits, directly reducing theamount of money in circulation. In addition, as people make withdrawals frombanks, banks find themselves with a smaller quantity of reserves. In response,banks reduce the amount of lending, and the process of money creation reversesitself.\\nOpen-market operations are easy to conduct. In fact, the Fed’s purchases and\\nsales of government bonds in the nation’s bond markets are similar to the transac-tions that any individual might undertake for his own portfolio. (Of course, whenan individual buys or sells a bond, money changes hands, but the amount ofmoney in circulation remains the same.) In addition, the Fed can use open-marketoperations to change the money supply by a small or large amount on any daywithout major changes in laws or bank regulations. Therefore, open-market oper-ations are the tool of monetary policy that the Fed uses most often.\\nReserve Requirements The Fed also influences the money supply with\\nreserve requirements, which are regulations on the minimum amount of reserves\\nthat banks must hold against deposits. Reserve requirements influence how muchmoney the banking system can create with each dollar of reserves. An increase inreserve requirements means that banks must hold more reserves and, therefore,can loan out less of each dollar that is deposited; as a result, it raises the reserve ra-tio, lowers the money multiplier, and decreases the money supply. Conversely, adecrease in reserve requirements lowers the reserve ratio, raises the money multi-plier, and increases the money supply.\\nThe Fed uses changes in reserve requirements only rarely because frequent\\nchanges would disrupt the business of banking. When the Fed increases reserverequirements, for instance, some banks find themselves short of reserves, eventhough they have seen no change in deposits. As a result, they have to curtail lend-ing until they build their level of reserves to the new required level.\\nThe Discount Rate The third tool in the Fed’s toolbox is the discount rate,\\nthe interest rate on the loans that the Fed makes to banks. A bank borrows from theFed when it has too few reserves to meet reserve requirements. This might occurbecause the bank made too many loans or because it has experienced recent with-drawals. When the Fed makes such a loan to a bank, the banking system has morereserves than it otherwise would, and these additional reserves allow the bankingsystem to create more money.\\nThe Fed can alter the money supply by changing the discount rate. A higher\\ndiscount rate discourages banks from borrowing reserves from the Fed. Thus, anincrease in the discount rate reduces the quantity of reserves in the bankingopen-market operations\\nthe purchase and sale of U.S.government bonds by the Fed\\nreserve requirements \\nregulations on the minimum amountof reserves that banks must holdagainst deposits\\ndiscount rate\\nthe interest rate on the loans that theFed makes to banksCHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 333\\nsystem, which in turn reduces the money supply. Conversely, a lower discount\\nrate encourages bank borrowing from the Fed, increases the quantity of reserves,and increases the money supply.\\nThe Fed uses discount lending not only to control the money supply but also\\nto help financial institutions when they are in trouble. For example, in 1984, ru-mors circulated that Continental Illinois National Bank had made a large numberof bad loans, and these rumors induced many depositors to withdraw their de-posits. As part of an effort to save the bank, the Fed acted as a lender of last resortand loaned Continental Illinois more than $5 billion. Similarly, when the stockmarket crashed on October 19, 1987, many Wall Street brokerage firms foundthemselves temporarily in need of funds to finance the high volume of stock trad-ing. The next morning, before the stock market opened, Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan announced the Fed’s “readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to sup-port the economic and financial system.” Many economists believe thatGreenspan’s reaction to the stock crash was an important reason why it had so fewrepercussions.\\nPROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING THE MONEY SUPPLY\\nThe Fed’s three tools—open-market operations, reserve requirements, and the dis-count rate—have powerful effects on the money supply. Yet the Fed’s control ofthe money supply is not precise. The Fed must wrestle with two problems, eachof which arises because much of the money supply is created by our system offractional-reserve banking.\\nThe first problem is that the Fed does not control the amount of money that\\nhouseholds choose to hold as deposits in banks. The more money households de-posit, the more reserves banks have, and the more money the banking system cancreate. And the less money households deposit, the less reserves banks have, andthe less money the banking system can create. To see why this is a problem, sup-pose that one day people begin to lose confidence in the banking system and,therefore, decide to withdraw deposits and hold more currency. When this hap-pens, the banking system loses reserves and creates less money. The money supplyfalls, even without any Fed action.\\nThe second problem of monetary control is that the Fed does not control the\\namount that bankers choose to lend. When money is deposited in a bank, it createsmore money only when the bank loans it out. Because banks can choose to holdexcess reserves instead, the Fed cannot be sure how much money the banking sys-tem will create. For instance, suppose that one day bankers become more cautiousabout economic conditions and decide to make fewer loans and hold greater re-serves. In this case, the banking system creates less money than it otherwisewould. Because of the bankers’ decision, the money supply falls.\\nHence, in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the amount of money in the\\neconomy depends in part on the behavior of depositors and bankers. Becausethe Fed cannot control or perfectly predict this behavior, it cannot perfectly controlthe money supply. Yet, if the Fed is vigilant, these problems need not be large. TheFed collects data on deposits and reserves from banks every week, so it is quicklyaware of any changes in depositor or banker behavior. It can, therefore, respond tothese changes and keep the money supply close to whatever level it chooses.334 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nCASE STUDY BANK RUNS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY\\nAlthough you have probably never witnessed a bank run in real life, you may\\nhave seen one depicted in movies such as Mary Poppins or It’s a Wonderful Life.\\nA bank run occurs when depositors suspect that a bank may go bankrupt and,therefore, “run” to the bank to withdraw their deposits.\\nBank runs are a problem for banks under fractional-reserve banking. Be-\\ncause a bank holds only a fraction of its deposits in reserve, it cannot satisfywithdrawal requests from all depositors. Even if the bank is in fact solvent\\n(meaning that its assets exceed its liabilities), it will not have enough cash onhand to allow all depositors immediate access to all of their money. When a runoccurs, the bank is forced to close its doors until some bank loans are repaid oruntil some lender of last resort (such as the Fed) provides it with the currency itneeds to satisfy depositors.\\nBank runs complicate the control of the money supply. An important exam-\\nple of this problem occurred during the Great Depression in the early 1930s. Af-ter a wave of bank runs and bank closings, households and bankers becamemore cautious. Households withdrew their deposits from banks, preferring tohold their money in the form of currency. This decision reversed the process ofmoney creation, as bankers responded to falling reserves by reducing bankloans. At the same time, bankers increased their reserve ratios so that theywould have enough cash on hand to meet their depositors’ demands in any fu-ture bank runs. The higher reserve ratio reduced the money multiplier, whichalso reduced the money supply. From 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell by 28percent, even without the Federal Reserve taking any deliberate contractionaryaction. Many economists point to this massive fall in the money supply to ex-plain the high unemployment and falling prices that prevailed during this pe-riod. (In future chapters we examine the mechanisms by which changes in themoney supply affect unemployment and prices.)\\nToday, bank runs are not a major problem for the banking system or the\\nFed. The federal government now guarantees the safety of deposits at mostbanks, primarily through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).Depositors do not run on their banks because they are confident that, evenif their bank goes bankrupt, the FDIC will make good on the deposits. The\\nANOT-SO-WONDERFUL\\nBANK RUNCHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 335\\npolicy of government deposit insurance has costs: Bankers whose deposits\\nare guaranteed may have too little incentive to avoid bad risks when makingloans. (This behavior is an example of a phenomenon, introduced in the pre-ceding chapter, called moral hazard. ) But one benefit of deposit insurance is a\\nmore stable banking system. As a result, most people see bank runs only in themovies.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Describe how banks create money. NIf the Fed wanted\\nto use all three of its policy tools to decrease the money supply, whatwould it do?\\nCONCLUSION\\nSome years ago, a book made the best-seller list with the title Secrets of the Temple:\\nHow the Federal Reserve Runs the Country. Although no doubt an exaggeration, this\\ntitle did highlight the important role of the monetary system in our daily lives.Whenever we buy or sell anything, we are relying on the extraordinarily useful so-cial convention called “money.” Now that we know what money is and what de-termines its supply, we can discuss how changes in the quantity of money affectthe economy. We begin to address that topic in the next chapter.\\nN The term money refers to assets that people regularly use\\nto buy goods and services.\\nN Money serves three functions.

Fiat money, such as paper dollars, ismoney without intrinsic value: It would be worthless ifit were not used as money.\\nN In the U.S. economy, money takes the form of currency\\nand various types of bank deposits, such as checkingaccounts.\\nN The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United\\nStates, is responsible for regulating the U.S. monetarysystem. The Fed chairman is appointed by the president\\nand confirmed by Congress every four years. Thechairman is the lead member of the Federal OpenMarket Committee, which meets about every six weeksto consider changes in monetary policy.\\nN The Fed controls the money supply primarily through\\nopen-market operations: The purchase of governmentbonds increases the money supply, and the sale ofgovernment bonds decreases the money supply. TheFed can also expand the money supply by loweringreserve requirements or decreasing the discount rate,and it can contract the money supply by raising reserverequirements or increasing the discount rate.\\nN When banks loan out some of their deposits, they\\nincrease the quantity of money in the economy.Because of this role of banks in determining themoney supply, the Fed’s control of the money supplyis imperfect.Summary336 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nmoney, p. 320\\nmedium of exchange, p. 321unit of account, p. 321store of value, p. 321liquidity, p. 321commodity money, p. 321fiat money, p. 323currency, p. 323\\ndemand deposits, p. 323Federal Reserve (Fed), p. 325central bank, p. 325money supply, p. 326monetary policy, p. 326reserves, p. 328fractional-reserve banking, p. 329\\nreserve ratio, p. 329money multiplier, p. 331open-market operations, p. 332reserve requirements, p. 332discount rate, p. 332\\nKey Concepts\\n1.

In one Trenton, New Jersey, candy store (run, inci-dentally, by this author’s grandmother in the 1930s), ice-cream cones came in twosizes. A cone with a small scoop of ice cream cost three cents. Hungry customerscould buy a large scoop for a nickel.\\nYou are probably not surprised at the increase in the price of ice cream. In our\\neconomy, most prices tend to rise over time. This increase in the overall level ofprices is called inflation. Earlier in the book we examined how economists measure\\nthe inflation rate as the percentage change in the consumer price index, the GDPdeflator, or some other index of the overall price level. These price indexes showthat, over the past 60 years, prices have risen on average about 5 percent per year. MONEY GROWTH\\nAND INFLATION\\n340 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nAccumulated over so many years, a 5 percent annual inflation rate leads to an\\n18-fold increase in the price level.\\nInflation may seem natural and inevitable to a person who grew up in the\\nUnited States during the second half of the twentieth century, but in fact it is notinevitable at all. There were long periods in the nineteenth century during whichmost prices fell—a phenomenon called deflation. The average level of prices in the\\nU.S. economy was 23 percent lower in 1896 than in 1880, and this deflation was amajor issue in the presidential election of 1896. Farmers, who had accumulatedlarge debts, were suffering when the fall in crop prices reduced their incomes andthus their ability to pay off their debts. They advocated government policies to re-verse the deflation.\\nAlthough inflation has been the norm in more recent history, there has been\\nsubstantial variation in the rate at which prices rise. During the 1990s, prices roseat an average rate of about 2 percent per year. By contrast, in the 1970s, prices roseby 7 percent per year, which meant a doubling of the price level over the decade.The public often views such high rates of inflation as a major economic problem.In fact, when President Jimmy Carter ran for reelection in 1980, challenger RonaldReagan pointed to high inflation as one of the failures of Carter’s economic policy.\\nInternational data show an even broader range of inflation experiences.\\nGermany after World War I experienced a spectacular example of inflation. Theprice of a newspaper rose from 0.3 marks in January 1921 to 70,000,000 marks lessthan two years later. Other prices rose by similar amounts. An extraordinarily highrate of inflation such as this is called hyperinflation. The German hyperinflation had\\nsuch an adverse effect on the German economy that it is often viewed as one con-tributor to the rise of Nazism and, as a result, World War II. Over the past 50 years,with this episode still in mind, German policymakers have been extraordinarilyaverse to inflation, and Germany has had much lower inflation than the UnitedStates.\\nWhat determines whether an economy experiences inflation and, if so, how\\nmuch? This chapter answers this question by developing the quantity theory of\\nmoney. Chapter 1 summarized this theory as one of the Ten Principles of Economics:\\nPrices rise when the government prints too much money. This insight has a longand venerable tradition among economists. The quantity theory was discussed bythe famous eighteenth-century philosopher David Hume and has been advocatedmore recently by the prominent economist Milton Friedman. This theory of infla-tion can explain both moderate inflations, such as those we have experienced inthe United States, and hyperinflations, such as those experienced in interwar Ger-many and, more recently, in some Latin American countries.\\nAfter developing a theory of inflation, we turn to a related question: Why is in-\\nflation a problem? At first glance, the answer to this question may seem obvious:Inflation is a problem because people don’t like it. In the 1970s, when the UnitedStates experienced a relatively high rate of inflation, opinion polls placed inflationas the most important issue facing the nation. President Ford echoed this senti-ment in 1974 when he called inflation “public enemy number one.” Ford brieflywore a “WIN” button on his lapel—for “Whip Inflation Now.”\\nBut what, exactly, are the costs that inflation imposes on a society? The answer\\nmay surprise you. Identifying the various costs of inflation is not as straightfor-ward as it first appears. As a result, although all economists decry hyperinflation,some economists argue that the costs of moderate inflation are not nearly as largeas the general public believes.\\nCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 341\\nTHE CLASSICAL THEORY OF INFLATION\\nWe begin our study of inflation by developing the quantity theory of money. This\\ntheory is often called “classical” because it was developed by some of the earliestthinkers about economic issues. Most economists today rely on this theory to ex-plain the long-run determinants of the price level and the inflation rate.\\nTHE LEVEL OF PRICES AND THE VALUE OF MONEY\\nSuppose we observe over some period of time the price of an ice-cream cone risingfrom a nickel to a dollar. What conclusion should we draw from the fact that peo-ple are willing to give up so much more money in exchange for a cone? It is possi-ble that people have come to enjoy ice cream more (perhaps because some chemisthas developed a miraculous new flavor). Yet that is probably not the case. It ismore likely that people’s enjoyment of ice cream has stayed roughly the same andthat, over time, the money used to buy ice cream has become less valuable. Indeed,the first insight about inflation is that it is more about the value of money thanabout the value of goods.\\nThis insight helps point the way toward a theory of inflation. When the con-\\nsumer price index and other measures of the price level rise, commentators areoften tempted to look at the many individual prices that make up these priceindexes: “The CPI rose by 3 percent last month, led by a 20 percent rise in theprice of coffee and a 30 percent rise in the price of heating oil.” Although this ap-proach does contain some interesting information about what’s happening in the\\n”So what’s it going to be? The same size as last year or the same price as last year?”342 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\neconomy, it also misses a key point: Inflation is an economy-wide phenomenon\\nthat concerns, first and foremost, the value of the economy’s medium of exchange.\\nThe economy’s overall price level can be viewed in two ways. So far, we have\\nviewed the price level as the price of a basket of goods and services. When theprice level rises, people have to pay more for the goods and services they buy. Al-ternatively, we can view the price level as a measure of the value of money. A risein the price level means a lower value of money because each dollar in your wal-let now buys a smaller quantity of goods and services.\\nIt may help to express these ideas mathematically. Suppose Pis the price level\\nas measured, for instance, by the consumer price index or the GDP deflator. ThenPmeasures the number of dollars needed to buy a basket of goods and services.\\nNow turn this idea around: The quantity of goods and services that can be boughtwith $1 equals 1/ P. In other words, if Pis the price of goods and services mea-\\nsured in terms of money, 1/ Pis the value of money measured in terms of goods\\nand services. Thus, when the overall price level rises, the value of money falls.\\nMONEY SUPPLY, MONEY DEMAND,\\nAND MONETARY EQUILIBRIUM\\nWhat determines the value of money? The answer to this question, like many in\\neconomics, is supply and demand. Just as the supply and demand for bananas de-termines the price of bananas, the supply and demand for money determines thevalue of money. Thus, our next step in developing the quantity theory of money isto consider the determinants of money supply and money demand.\\nFirst consider money supply. In the preceding chapter we discussed how the\\nFederal Reserve, together with the banking system, determines the supply ofmoney. When the Fed sells bonds in open-market operations, it receives dollars inexchange and contracts the money supply. When the Fed buys government bonds,it pays out dollars and expands the money supply. In addition, if any of these dol-lars are deposited in banks who then hold them as reserves, the money multiplierswings into action, and these open-market operations can have an even greater ef-fect on the money supply. For our purposes in this chapter, we ignore the compli-cations introduced by the banking system and simply take the quantity of moneysupplied as a policy variable that the Fed controls directly and completely.\\nNow consider money demand. There are many factors that determine the\\nquantity of money people demand, just as there are many determinants of thequantity demanded of other goods and services. How much money people chooseto hold in their wallets, for instance, depends on how much they rely on creditcards and on whether an automatic teller machine is easy to find. And, as we willemphasize in Chapter 20, the quantity of money demanded depends on the inter-est rate that a person could earn by using the money to buy an interest-bearingbond rather than leaving it in a wallet or low-interest checking account.\\nAlthough many variables affect the demand for money, one variable stands\\nout in importance: the average level of prices in the economy. People hold moneybecause it is the medium of exchange. Unlike other assets, such as bonds or stocks,people can use money to buy the goods and services on their shopping lists. Howmuch money they choose to hold for this purpose depends on the prices of thosegoods and services. The higher prices are, the more money the typical transactionrequires, and the more money people will choose to hold in their wallets andCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 343\\nchecking accounts. That is, a higher price level (a lower value of money) increases\\nthe quantity of money demanded.\\nWhat ensures that the quantity of money the Fed supplies balances the quan-\\ntity of money people demand? The answer, it turns out, depends on the time hori-zon being considered. Later in this book we will examine the short-run answer,and we will see that interest rates play a key role. In the long run, however, the an-swer is different and much simpler. In the long run, the overall level of prices adjusts\\nto the level at which the demand for money equals the supply. If the price level is above\\nthe equilibrium level, people will want to hold more money than the Fed has cre-ated, so the price level must fall to balance supply and demand. If the price level isbelow the equilibrium level, people will want to hold less money than the Fed hascreated, and the price level must rise to balance supply and demand. At the equi-librium price level, the quantity of money that people want to hold exactly bal-ances the quantity of money supplied by the Fed.\\nFigure 16-1 illustrates these ideas. The horizontal axis of this graph shows the\\nquantity of money. The left-hand vertical axis shows the value of money, 1/ P,and\\nthe right-hand vertical axis shows the price level, P.Notice that the price-level axis\\non the right is inverted: A low price level is shown near the top of this axis, and ahigh price level is shown near the bottom. This inverted axis illustrates that whenthe value of money is high (as shown near the top of the left axis), the price level islow (as shown near the top of the right axis).\\nThe two curves in this figure are the supply and demand curves for money.\\nThe supply curve is vertical because the Fed has fixed the quantity of money avail-able. The demand curve for money is downward sloping, indicating that when thevalue of money is low (and the price level is high), people demand a larger quan-tity of it to buy goods and services. At the equilibrium, shown in the figure aspoint A, the quantity of money demanded balances the quantity of money sup-plied. This equilibrium of money supply and money demand determines the valueof money and the price level.Quantity fixed\\nby the FedQuantity of\\nMoneyValue of\\nMoney, 1/PPrice Level, \\nP\\nAMoney supply\\n01\\n(Low)(High)\\n(High)(Low)\\n1/2\\n1/43/41\\n1.3324\\nEquilibrium\\nvalue ofmoneyEquilibrium\\nprice level\\nMoney\\ndemandFigure 16-1\\nHOW THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND\\nFOR MONEY DETERMINE THE\\nEQUILIBRIUM PRICE LEVEL .\\nThe horizontal axis shows thequantity of money.

To do so, imagine\\nthat the economy is in equilibrium and then, suddenly, the Fed doubles the supplyof money by printing some dollar bills and dropping them around the countryfrom helicopters. (Or, less dramatically and more realistically, the Fed could injectmoney into the economy by buying some government bonds from the public inopen-market operations.) What happens after such a monetary injection? Howdoes the new equilibrium compare to the old one?\\nFigure 16-2 shows what happens. The monetary injection shifts the supply\\ncurve to the right from MS\\n1to MS2, and the equilibrium moves from point A to\\npoint B. As a result, the value of money (shown on the left axis) decreases from 1/2to 1/4, and the equilibrium price level (shown on the right axis) increases from2 to 4. In other words, when an increase in the money supply makes dollars moreplentiful, the result is an increase in the price level that makes each dollar lessvaluable.\\nThis explanation of how the price level is determined and why it might change\\nover time is called the quantity theory of money. According to the quantity theory,\\nthe quantity of money available in the economy determines the value of money,and growth in the quantity of money is the primary cause of inflation. As econo-mist Milton Friedman once put it, “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetaryphenomenon.”\\nA BRIEF LOOK AT THE ADJUSTMENT PROCESS\\nSo far we have compared the old equilibrium and the new equilibrium after an in-jection of money.

Thus, when anincrease in the money supplymakes dollars more plentiful, theprice level increases, making eachdollar less valuable.quantity theory of money\\na theory asserting that the quantityof money available determines theprice level and that the growth ratein the quantity of money availabledetermines the inflation rateCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 345\\nA complete answer to this question requires an understanding of short-run\\nfluctuations in the economy, which we examine later in this book. Yet, even now, itis instructive to consider briefly the adjustment process that occurs after a changein money supply.\\nThe immediate effect of a monetary injection is to create an excess supply\\nof money. Before the injection, the economy was in equilibrium (point A in Fig-ure 16-2). At the prevailing price level, people had exactly as much money as theywanted. But after the helicopters drop the new money and people pick it up off thestreets, people have more dollars in their wallets than they want. At the prevailingprice level, the quantity of money supplied now exceeds the quantity demanded.\\nPeople try to get rid of this excess supply of money in various ways. They\\nmight buy goods and services with their excess holdings of money. Or they mightuse this excess money to make loans to others by buying bonds or by depositingthe money in a bank savings account. These loans allow other people to buy goodsand services. In either case, the injection of money increases the demand forgoods and services.\\nThe economy’s ability to supply goods and services, however, has not\\nchanged. As we saw in Chapter 12, the economy’s production is determined by theavailable labor, physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and techno-logical knowledge. None of these is altered by the injection of money.\\nThus, the greater demand for goods and services causes the prices of goods\\nand services to increase. The increase in the price level, in turn, increases the quan-tity of money demanded because people are using more dollars for every transac-tion. Eventually, the economy reaches a new equilibrium (point B in Figure 16-2) atwhich the quantity of money demanded again equals the quantity of money sup-plied. In this way, the overall price level for goods and services adjusts to bringmoney supply and money demand into balance.\\nTHE CLASSICAL DICHOTOMY AND MONETARY NEUTRALITY\\nWe have seen how changes in the money supply lead to changes in the averagelevel of prices of goods and services. How do these monetary changes affect otherimportant macroeconomic variables, such as production, employment, real wages,and real interest rates? This question has long intrigued economists. Indeed, thegreat philosopher David Hume wrote about it in the eighteenth century. The an-swer we give today owes much to Hume’s analysis.\\nHume and his contemporaries suggested that all economic variables should be\\ndivided into two groups. The first group consists of nominal variables —variables\\nmeasured in monetary units. The second group consists of real variables —vari-\\nables measured in physical units. For example, the income of corn farmers is anominal variable because it is measured in dollars, whereas the quantity of cornthey produce is a real variable because it is measured in bushels. Similarly, nomi-nal GDP is a nominal variable because it measures the dollar value of the econ-omy’s output of goods and services, while real GDP is a real variable because itmeasures the total quantity of goods and services produced. This separation ofvariables into these groups is now called the classical dichotomy. (Adichotomy is a\\ndivision into two groups, and classical refers to the earlier economic thinkers.)\\nApplication of the classical dichotomy is somewhat tricky when we turn\\nto prices. Prices in the economy are normally quoted in terms of money and,nominal variables\\nvariables measured inmonetary units\\nreal variables\\nvariables measured in physical units\\nclassical dichotomy\\nthe theoretical separation of nominaland real variables346 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\ntherefore, are nominal variables. For instance, when we say that the price of corn\\nis $2 a bushel or that the price of wheat is $1 a bushel, both prices are nominal vari-ables. But what about a relative price—the price of one thing compared to another?\\nIn our example, we could say that the price of a bushel of corn is two bushels ofwheat. Notice that this relative price is no longer measured in terms of money.When comparing the prices of any two goods, the dollar signs cancel, and the re-sulting number is measured in physical units. The lesson is that dollar prices arenominal variables, whereas relative prices are real variables.\\nThis lesson has several important applications. For instance, the real wage (the\\ndollar wage adjusted for inflation) is a real variable because it measures the rate atwhich the economy exchanges goods and services for each unit of labor. Similarly,the real interest rate (the nominal interest rate adjusted for inflation) is a real vari-able because it measures the rate at which the economy exchanges goods and ser-vices produced today for goods and services produced in the future.\\nWhy bother separating variables into these two groups? Hume suggested that\\nthe classical dichotomy is useful in analyzing the economy because different forcesinfluence real and nominal variables. In particular, he argued, nominal variablesare heavily influenced by developments in the economy’s monetary system,whereas the monetary system is largely irrelevant for understanding the determi-nants of important real variables.\\nNotice that Hume’s idea was implicit in our earlier discussions of the real\\neconomy in the long run. In previous chapters, we examined how real GDP , sav-ing, investment, real interest rates, and unemployment are determined withoutany mention of the existence of money. As explained in that analysis, the econ-omy’s production of goods and services depends on productivity and factor sup-plies, the real interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for loanablefunds, the real wage adjusts to balance the supply and demand for labor, and un-employment results when the real wage is for some reason kept above its equilib-rium level. These important conclusions have nothing to do with the quantity ofmoney supplied.\\nChanges in the supply of money, according to Hume, affect nominal variables\\nbut not real variables. When the central bank doubles the money supply, the pricelevel doubles, the dollar wage doubles, and all other dollar values double. Realvariables, such as production, employment, real wages, and real interest rates, areunchanged. This irrelevance of monetary changes for real variables is called mone-\\ntary neutrality.\\nAn analogy sheds light on the meaning of monetary neutrality. Recall that, as\\nthe unit of account, money is the yardstick we use to measure economic transac-tions. When a central bank doubles the money supply, all prices double, and thevalue of the unit of account falls by half. A similar change would occur if the gov-ernment were to reduce the length of the yard from 36 to 18 inches: As a result ofthe new unit of measurement, all measured distances (nominal variables) would\\ndouble, but the actual distances (real variables) would remain the same. The dollar,\\nlike the yard, is merely a unit of measurement, so a change in its value should nothave important real effects.\\nIs this conclusion of monetary neutrality a realistic description of the world in\\nwhich we live? The answer is: not completely. A change in the length of the yardfrom 36 to 18 inches would not matter much in the long run, but in the short run itwould certainly lead to confusion and various mistakes. Similarly, most econo-mists today believe that over short periods of time—within the span of a year or\\nmonetary neutrality\\nthe proposition that changes inthe money supply do not affectreal variablesCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 347\\ntwo—there is reason to think that monetary changes do have important effects on\\nreal variables. Hume himself also doubted that monetary neutrality would applyin the short run. (We will turn to the study of short-run nonneutrality in Chap-ters 19 to 21, and this topic will shed light on the reasons why the Fed changes thesupply of money over time.)\\nMost economists today accept Hume’s conclusion as a description of the econ-\\nomy in the long run. Over the course of a decade, for instance, monetary changeshave important effects on nominal variables (such as the price level) but only neg-ligible effects on real variables (such as real GDP). When studying long-runchanges in the economy, the neutrality of money offers a good description of howthe world works.\\nVELOCITY AND THE QUANTITY EQUATION\\nWe can obtain another perspective on the quantity theory of money by consider-ing the following question: How many times per year is the typical dollar bill usedto pay for a newly produced good or service? The answer to this question is givenby a variable called the velocity of money. In physics, the term velocity refers to the\\nspeed at which an object travels. In economics, the velocity of money refers tothe speed at which the typical dollar bill travels around the economy from walletto wallet.\\nTo calculate the velocity of money, we divide the nominal value of output\\n(nominal GDP) by the quantity of money. If Pis the price level (the GDP deflator),\\nYthe quantity of output (real GDP), and Mthe quantity of money, then velocity is\\nV/H11005 (P/H11003 Y)/M.\\nTo see why this makes sense, imagine a simple economy that produces only pizza.\\nSuppose that the economy produces 100 pizzas in a year, that a pizza sells for$10, and that the quantity of money in the economy is $50. Then the velocity ofmoney is\\nV/H11005 ($10 /H11003 100)/$50\\n/H1100520.\\nIn this economy, people spend a total of $1,000 per year on pizza. For this $1,000 of\\nspending to take place with only $50 of money, each dollar bill must change handson average 20 times per year.\\nWith slight algebraic rearrangement, this equation can be rewritten as\\nM/H11003 V/H11005P/H11003 Y.\\nThis equation states that the quantity of money ( M) times the velocity of money\\n(V) equals the price of output ( P) times the amount of output ( Y). It is called the\\nquantity equation because it relates the quantity of money ( M) to the nominal\\nvalue of output ( P/H11003 Y). The quantity equation shows that an increase in the quan-\\ntity of money in an economy must be reflected in one of the other three variables:velocity of money\\nthe rate at which moneychanges hands\\nquantity equation\\nthe equation M /H11003 V /H11005P/H11003 Y, which\\nrelates the quantity of money, thevelocity of money, and the dollarvalue of the economy’s output ofgoods and services348 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nThe price level must rise, the quantity of output must rise, or the velocity of money\\nmust fall.\\nIn many cases, it turns out that the velocity of money is relatively stable. For\\nexample, Figure 16-3 shows nominal GDP , the quantity of money (as measured byM2), and the velocity of money for the U.S. economy since 1960. Although the ve-locity of money is not exactly constant, it has not changed dramatically. By con-trast, the money supply and nominal GDP during this period have increased morethan tenfold. Thus, for some purposes, the assumption of constant velocity may bea good approximation.\\nWe now have all the elements necessary to explain the equilibrium price level\\nand inflation rate. Here they are:\\n1. The velocity of money is relatively stable over time.\\n2. Because velocity is stable, when the Fed changes the quantity of money ( M),\\nit causes proportionate changes in the nominal value of output ( P/H11003 Y).\\n3. The economy’s output of goods and services ( Y) is primarily determined by\\nfactor supplies (labor, physical capital, human capital, and natural resources)and the available production technology. In particular, because money isneutral, money does not affect output.\\n4. With output ( Y) determined by factor supplies and technology, when the\\nFed alters the money supply ( M) and induces proportional changes in\\nthe nominal value of output ( P/H11003 Y), these changes are reflected in\\nchanges in the price level ( P).\\n5. Therefore, when the Fed increases the money supply rapidly, the result is a\\nhigh rate of inflation.\\nThese five steps are the essence of the quantity theory of money.Indexes\\n(1960 = 100)\\n1,500\\n1,000\\n500\\n0\\n1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000VelocityM2Nominal GDPFigure 16-3\\nNOMINAL GDP , THE\\nQUANTITY OF MONEY , AND\\nTHE VELOCITY OF MONEY .

This figure shows the quantity \\nof money and the price level during four hyperinflations. (Note that these variables aregraphed on logarithmic scales. This means that equal vertical distances on the graph\\nrepresent equal percentage changes in the variable.) In each case, the quantity of money\\nand the price level move closely together. The strong association between these twovariables is consistent with the quantity theory of money, which states that growth in the money supply is the primary cause of inflation.\\nSOURCE : Adapted from Thomas J. Sargent, “The End of Four Big Inflations,” in Robert Hall, ed., Inflation, Chicago:\\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1983, pp. 41-93.350 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nTHE INFLATION TAX\\nIf inflation is so easy to explain, why do countries experience hyperinflation? That\\nis, why do the central banks of these countries choose to print so much money thatits value is certain to fall rapidly over time?\\nThe answer is that the governments of these countries are using money cre-\\nation as a way to pay for their spending. When the government wants to buildroads, pay salaries to police officers, or give transfer payments to the poor or el-derly, it first has to raise the necessary funds. Normally, the government does thisby levying taxes, such as income and sales taxes, and by borrowing from the pub-lic by selling government bonds. Yet the government can also pay for spending bysimply printing the money it needs.\\nWhen the government raises revenue by printing money, it is said to levy an\\ninflation tax. The inflation tax is not exactly like other taxes, however, because no\\none receives a bill from the government for this tax. Instead, the inflation tax ismore subtle. When the government prints money, the price level rises, and the dol-lars in your wallet are less valuable. Thus, the inflation tax is like a tax on everyone\\nwho holds money.\\nThe importance of the inflation tax varies from country to country and over\\ntime. In the United States in recent years, the inflation tax has been a trivial sourceof revenue: It has accounted for less than 3 percent of government revenue. Dur-ing the 1770s, however, the Continental Congress of the fledgling United States re-lied heavily on the inflation tax to pay for military spending. Because the newgovernment had a limited ability to raise funds through regular taxes or borrow-ing, printing dollars was the easiest way to pay the American soldiers. As thequantity theory predicts, the result was a high rate of inflation: Prices measured interms of the continental dollar rose more than 100-fold over a few years.\\nAlmost all hyperinflations follow the same pattern as the hyperinflation dur-\\ning the American Revolution. The government has high spending, inadequate taxrevenue, and limited ability to borrow. As a result, it turns to the printing pressto pay for its spending. The massive increases in the quantity of money lead toinflation tax\\nthe revenue the governmentraises by creating moneyas inflation that exceeds 50 percent per month. This means that the price level in-\\ncreases more than 100-fold over the course of a year.\\nThe data on hyperinflation show a clear link between the quantity of money\\nand the price level. Figure 16-4 graphs data from four classic hyperinflationsthat occurred during the 1920s in Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Poland. Eachgraph shows the quantity of money in the economy and an index of the pricelevel. The slope of the money line represents the rate at which the quantity ofmoney was growing, and the slope of the price line represents the inflation rate.The steeper the lines, the higher the rates of money growth or inflation.\\nNotice that in each graph the quantity of money and the price level are al-\\nmost parallel. In each instance, growth in the quantity of money is moderate atfirst, and so is inflation. But over time, the quantity of money in the economystarts growing faster and faster. At about the same time, inflation also takes off.Then when the quantity of money stabilizes, the price level stabilizes as well.These episodes illustrate well one of the Ten Principles of Economics: Prices rise\\nwhen the government prints too much money.\\nCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 351\\nmassive inflation. The inflation ends when the government institutes fiscal\\nreforms—such as cuts in government spending—that eliminate the need for theinflation tax.\\nTHE FISHER EFFECT\\nAccording to the principle of monetary neutrality, an increase in the rate of moneygrowth raises the rate of inflation but does not affect any real variable. An impor-tant application of this principle concerns the effect of money on interest rates. In-terest rates are important variables for macroeconomists to understand becausethey link the economy of the present and the economy of the future through theireffects on saving and investment.\\nTo understand the relationship between money, inflation, and interest rates,\\nrecall from Chapter 11 the distinction between the nominal interest rate and thereal interest rate. The nominal interest rate is the interest rate you hear about at your\\nbank. If you have a savings account, for instance, the nominal interest rate tells youhow fast the number of dollars in your account will rise over time. The real interest\\nratecorrects the nominal interest rate for the effect of inflation in order to tell you\\nhow fast the purchasing power of your savings account will rise over time. Thereal interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate:\\nReal interest rate /H11005Nominal interest rate /H11002 Inflation rate.WHENEVER GOVERNMENTS FIND THEM -\\nselves short of cash, they are tempted tosolve the problem simply by printingsome more.

A3.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nRussia Turns to\\nthe Inflation Tax352 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nFor example, if the bank posts a nominal interest rate of 7 percent per year and the\\ninflation rate is 3 percent per year, then the real value of the deposits grows by 4percent per year.\\nWe can rewrite this equation to show that the nominal interest rate is the sum\\nof the real interest rate and the inflation rate:\\nNominal interest rate /H11005Real interest rate /H11001Inflation rate.\\nThis way of looking at the nominal interest rate is useful because different eco-\\nnomic forces determine each of the two terms on the right-hand side of this equa-tion. As we discussed in Chapter 13, the supply and demand for loanable fundsdetermine the real interest rate. And, according to the quantity theory of money,growth in the money supply determines the inflation rate.\\nLet’s now consider how the growth in the money supply affects interest rates.\\nIn the long run over which money is neutral, a change in money growth shouldnot affect the real interest rate. The real interest rate is, after all, a real variable. Forthe real interest rate not to be affected, the nominal interest rate must adjust one-for-one to changes in the inflation rate. Thus, when the Fed increases the rate of money\\ngrowth, the result is both a higher inflation rate and a higher nominal interest rate. This\\nadjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate is called the Fisher\\neffect, after economist Irving Fisher (1867-1947), who first studied it.\\nThe Fisher effect is, in fact, crucial for understanding changes over time in the\\nnominal interest rate. Figure 16-5 shows the nominal interest rate and the inflationrate in the U.S. economy since 1960. The close association between these two vari-ables is clear. The nominal interest rate rose from the early 1960s through the 1970sbecause inflation was also rising during this time. Similarly, the nominal interestrate fell from the early 1980s through the 1990s because the Fed got inflation undercontrol.\\nFisher effect\\nthe one-for-one adjustmentof the nominal interest rate tothe inflation rate\\nPercent\\n(per year)\\n1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995InflationNominal interest rate\\n03691215Figure 16-5\\nTHENOMINAL INTEREST RATE\\nAND THE INFLATION RATE.\\nThis figure uses annual data since1960 to show the nominal interestrate on three-month Treasurybills and the inflation rate asmeasured by the consumer priceindex.

Whathappens to prices? What happens to nominal interest rates? Why might thegovernment be doing this?\\nTHE COSTS OF INFLATION\\nIn the late 1970s, when the U.S. inflation rate reached about 10 percent per year, in-flation dominated debates over economic policy. And even though inflation waslow during the 1990s, inflation remained a closely watched macroeconomic vari-able. One 1996 study found that inflation was the economic term mentioned most\\noften in U.S. newspapers (far ahead of second-place finisher unemployment and\\nthird-place finisher productivity ).\\nInflation is closely watched and widely discussed because it is thought to be a\\nserious economic problem. But is that true? And if so, why?\\nA FALL IN PURCHASING POWER? THE INFLATION FALLACY\\nIf you ask the typical person why inflation is bad, he will tell you that the answeris obvious: Inflation robs him of the purchasing power of his hard-earned dollars.When prices rise, each dollar of income buys fewer goods and services. Thus, itmight seem that inflation directly lowers living standards.\\nYet further thought reveals a fallacy in this answer. When prices rise, buyers of\\ngoods and services pay more for what they buy. At the same time, however, sellersof goods and services get more for what they sell. Because most people earn theirincomes by selling their services, such as their labor, inflation in incomes goeshand in hand with inflation in prices. Thus, inflation does not in itself reduce people’s\\nreal purchasing power.\\nPeople believe the inflation fallacy because they do not appreciate the princi-\\nple of monetary neutrality. A worker who receives an annual raise of 10 percenttends to view that raise as a reward for her own talent and effort. When an infla-tion rate of 6 percent reduces the real value of that raise to only 4 percent, theworker might feel that she has been cheated of what is rightfully her due. In fact,as we discussed in Chapter 12, real incomes are determined by real variables, suchas physical capital, human capital, natural resources, and the available productiontechnology. Nominal incomes are determined by those factors and the overallprice level. If the Fed were to lower the inflation rate from 6 percent to zero, ourworker’s annual raise would fall from 10 percent to 4 percent. She might feel lessrobbed by inflation, but her real income would not rise more quickly.\\nIf nominal incomes tend to keep pace with rising prices, why then is inflation\\na problem? It turns out that there is no single answer to this question. Instead,economists have identified several costs of inflation. Each of these costs showssome way in which persistent growth in the money supply does, in fact, havesome effect on real variables.354 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nSHOELEATHER COSTS\\nAs we have discussed, inflation is like a tax on the holders of money. The tax itself\\nis not a cost to society: It is only a transfer of resources from households to the gov-ernment. Yet, as we first saw in Chapter 8, most taxes give people an incentive toalter their behavior to avoid paying the tax, and this distortion of incentives causesdeadweight losses for society as a whole. Like other taxes, the inflation tax alsocauses deadweight losses because people waste scarce resources trying to avoid it.\\nHow can a person avoid paying the inflation tax? Because inflation erodes the\\nreal value of the money in your wallet, you can avoid the inflation tax by holdingless money. One way to do this is to go to the bank more often. For example, ratherthan withdrawing $200 every four weeks, you might withdraw $50 once a week.By making more frequent trips to the bank, you can keep more of your wealth inyour interest-bearing savings account and less in your wallet, where inflationerodes its value.\\nThe cost of reducing your money holdings is called the shoeleather cost of\\ninflation because making more frequent trips to the bank causes your shoes towear out more quickly. Of course, this term is not to be taken literally: The actualcost of reducing your money holdings is not the wear and tear on your shoes butthe time and convenience you must sacrifice to keep less money on hand than youwould if there were no inflation.\\nThe shoeleather costs of inflation may seem trivial. And, in fact, they are in the\\nU.S. economy, which has had only moderate inflation in recent years. But this costis magnified in countries experiencing hyperinflation. Here is a description of oneperson’s experience in Bolivia during its hyperinflation (as reported in the August13, 1985, issue of The Wall Street Journal, p. 1):\\nWhen Edgar Miranda gets his monthly teacher’s pay of 25 million pesos, he\\nhasn’t a moment to lose. Every hour, pesos drop in value. So, while his wiferushes to market to lay in a month’s supply of rice and noodles, he is off with therest of the pesos to change them into black-market dollars.\\nMr. Miranda is practicing the First Rule of Survival amid the most out-of-\\ncontrol inflation in the world today. Bolivia is a case study of how runawayinflation undermines a society. Price increases are so huge that the figures buildup almost beyond comprehension. In one six-month period, for example, pricessoared at an annual rate of 38,000 percent. By official count, however, last year’sinflation reached 2,000 percent, and this year’s is expected to hit 8,000 percent—though other estimates range many times higher. In any event, Bolivia’s ratedwarfs Israel’s 370 percent and Argentina’s 1,100 percent—two other cases ofsevere inflation.\\nIt is easier to comprehend what happens to the 38-year-old Mr. Miranda’s\\npay if he doesn’t quickly change it into dollars. The day he was paid 25 millionpesos, a dollar cost 500,000 pesos. So he received $50. Just days later, with the rateat 900,000 pesos, he would have received $27.\\nAs this story shows, the shoeleather costs of inflation can be substantial. With the\\nhigh inflation rate, Mr. Miranda does not have the luxury of holding the localmoney as a store of value. Instead, he is forced to convert his pesos quickly intogoods or into U.S. dollars, which offer a more stable store of value. The time andeffort that Mr. Miranda expends to reduce his money holdings are a waste ofshoeleather costs\\nthe resources wasted when inflationencourages people to reduce theirmoney holdingsCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 355\\nresources. If the monetary authority pursued a low-inflation policy, Mr. Miranda\\nwould be happy to hold pesos, and he could put his time and effort to moreproductive use. In fact, shortly after this article was written, the Bolivian inflationrate was reduced substantially with more restrictive monetary policy.WHENEVER GOVERNMENTS TURN TO THE\\nprinting press to finance substantial\\namounts of spending, the result is hy-perinflation.

A1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nThe Hyperinflation in Serbia356 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nMENU COSTS\\nMost firms do not change the prices of their products every day. Instead, firms of-\\nten announce prices and leave them unchanged for weeks, months, or even years.One survey found that the typical U.S. firm changes its prices about once a year.\\nFirms change prices infrequently because there are costs of changing prices.\\nCosts of price adjustment are called menu costs, a term derived from a restaurant’s\\ncost of printing a new menu. Menu costs include the cost of deciding on newprices, the cost of printing new price lists and catalogs, the cost of sending thesenew price lists and catalogs to dealers and customers, the cost of advertising thenew prices, and even the cost of dealing with customer annoyance over pricechanges.\\nInflation increases the menu costs that firms must bear. In the current U.S.\\neconomy, with its low inflation rate, annual price adjustment is an appropriatebusiness strategy for many firms. But when high inflation makes firms’ costs riserapidly, annual price adjustment is impractical. During hyperinflations, for exam-ple, firms must change their prices daily or even more often just to keep up withall the other prices in the economy.\\nRELATIVE-PRICE VARIABILITY\\nAND THE MISALLOCATION OF RESOURCES\\nSuppose that the Eatabit Eatery prints a new menu with new prices every January\\nand then leaves its prices unchanged for the rest of the year. If there is no inflation,Eatabit’s relative prices—the prices of its meals compared to other prices in theeconomy—would be constant over the course of the year. By contrast, if the infla-tion rate is 12 percent per year, Eatabit’s relative prices will automatically fall by 1percent each month. The restaurant’s relative prices (that is, its prices comparedwith others in the economy) will be high in the early months of the year, just afterit has printed a new menu, and low in the later months. And the higher the infla-tion rate, the greater is this automatic variability. Thus, because prices change onlyonce in a while, inflation causes relative prices to vary more than they otherwisewould.\\nWhy does this matter? The reason is that market economies rely on relative\\nprices to allocate scarce resources. Consumers decide what to buy by comparingthe quality and prices of various goods and services. Through these decisions, theydetermine how the scarce factors of production are allocated among industries andfirms. When inflation distorts relative prices, consumer decisions are distorted,and markets are less able to allocate resources to their best use.\\nINFLATION-INDUCED TAX DISTORTIONS\\nAlmost all taxes distort incentives, cause people to alter their behavior, and leadto a less efficient allocation of the economy’s resources. Many taxes, however,become even more problematic in the presence of inflation. The reason is thatlawmakers often fail to take inflation into account when writing the tax laws.menu costs\\nthe costs of changing pricesCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 357\\nEconomists who have studied the tax code conclude that inflation tends to raise\\nthe tax burden on income earned from savings.\\nOne example of how inflation discourages saving is the tax treatment of capital\\ngains —the profits made by selling an asset for more than its purchase price. Sup-\\npose that in 1980 you used some of your savings to buy stock in Microsoft Corpo-ration for $10 and that in 2000 you sold the stock for $50. According to the tax law,you have earned a capital gain of $40, which you must include in your incomewhen computing how much income tax you owe. But suppose the overall pricelevel doubled from 1980 to 2000. In this case, the $10 you invested in 1980 is equiv-alent (in terms of purchasing power) to $20 in 2000. When you sell your stock for$50, you have a real gain (an increase in purchasing power) of only $30. The taxcode, however, does not take account of inflation and assesses you a tax on a gainof $40. Thus, inflation exaggerates the size of capital gains and inadvertently in-creases the tax burden on this type of income.\\nAnother example is the tax treatment of interest income. The income tax treats\\nthe nominal interest earned on savings as income, even though part of the nominal\\ninterest rate merely compensates for inflation. To see the effects of this policy, con-sider the numerical example in Table 16-1. The table compares two economies,both of which tax interest income at a rate of 25 percent. In Economy 1, inflation iszero, and the nominal and real interest rates are both 4 percent. In this case, the25 percent tax on interest income reduces the real interest rate from 4 percent to3 percent. In Economy 2, the real interest rate is again 4 percent, but the inflationrate is 8 percent. As a result of the Fisher effect, the nominal interest rate is 12 per-cent. Because the income tax treats this entire 12 percent interest as income, thegovernment takes 25 percent of it, leaving an after-tax nominal interest rate of only9 percent and an after-tax real interest rate of only 1 percent. In this case, the25 percent tax on interest income reduces the real interest rate from 4 percent to1 percent. Because the after-tax real interest rate provides the incentive to save,saving is much less attractive in the economy with inflation (Economy 2) than inthe economy with stable prices (Economy 1).\\nTable 16-1\\nHOWINFLATION RAISES THE\\nTAXBURDEN ON SAVING .\\nIn the presence of zero inflation, a25 percent tax on interest incomereduces the real interest rate from4 percent to 3 percent.

There are many others.Because of these inflation-induced tax changes, higher inflation tends to discour-age people from saving. Recall that the economy’s saving provides the resourcesfor investment, which in turn is a key ingredient to long-run economic growth.Thus, when inflation raises the tax burden on saving, it tends to depress the econ-omy’s long-run growth rate. There is, however, no consensus among economistsabout the size of this effect.\\nOne solution to this problem, other than eliminating inflation, is to index the\\ntax system. That is, the tax laws could be rewritten to take account of the effects ofinflation. In the case of capital gains, for example, the tax code could adjust thepurchase price using a price index and assess the tax only on the real gain. In thecase of interest income, the government could tax only real interest income by ex-cluding that portion of the interest income that merely compensates for inflation.To some extent, the tax laws have moved in the direction of indexation. For exam-ple, the income levels at which income tax rates change are adjusted automaticallyeach year based on changes in the consumer price index. Yet many other aspects ofthe tax laws—such as the tax treatment of capital gains and interest income—arenot indexed.\\nIn an ideal world, the tax laws would be written so that inflation would not\\nalter anyone’s real tax liability. In the world in which we live, however, tax lawsare far from perfect. More complete indexation would probably be desirable, butit would further complicate a tax code that many people already consider toocomplex.\\nCONFUSION AND INCONVENIENCE\\nImagine that we took a poll and asked people the following question: “This yearthe yard is 36 inches. How long do you think it should be next year?” Assum-ing we could get people to take us seriously, they would tell us that the yardshould stay the same length—36 inches. Anything else would just complicate lifeneedlessly.\\nWhat does this finding have to do with inflation? Recall that money, as the\\neconomy’s unit of account, is what we use to quote prices and record debts. Inother words, money is the yardstick with which we measure economic transac-tions. The job of the Federal Reserve is a bit like the job of the Bureau of Stan-dards—to ensure the reliability of a commonly used unit of measurement. Whenthe Fed increases the money supply and creates inflation, it erodes the real valueof the unit of account.\\nIt is difficult to judge the costs of the confusion and inconvenience that arise\\nfrom inflation. Earlier we discussed how the tax code incorrectly measures real in-comes in the presence of inflation. Similarly, accountants incorrectly measurefirms’ earnings when prices are rising over time. Because inflation causes dollarsat different times to have different real values, computing a firm’s profit—the dif-ference between its revenue and costs—is more complicated in an economy withinflation. Therefore, to some extent, inflation makes investors less able to sort outsuccessful from unsuccessful firms, which in turn impedes financial markets intheir role of allocating the economy’s saving to alternative types of investment.CHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 359\\nCASE STUDY THE WIZARD OF OZ\\nAND THE FREE-SILVER DEBATE\\nAs a child, you probably saw the movie The Wizard of Oz, based on a children’s\\nbook written in 1900. The movie and book tell the story of a young girl,Dorothy, who finds herself lost in a strange land far from home. You probablydid not know, however, that the story is actually an allegory about U.S. mone-tary policy in the late nineteenth century.\\nFrom 1880 to 1896, the price level in the U.S. economy fell by 23 percent.\\nBecause this event was unanticipated, it led to a major redistribution ofA SPECIAL COST OF UNEXPECTED INFLATION:\\nARBITRARY REDISTRIBUTIONS OF WEALTH\\nSo far, the costs of inflation we have discussed occur even if inflation is steady and\\npredictable. Inflation has an additional cost, however, when it comes as a surprise.Unexpected inflation redistributes wealth among the population in a way that hasnothing to do with either merit or need. These redistributions occur because manyloans in the economy are specified in terms of the unit of account—money.\\nConsider an example. Suppose that Sam Student takes out a $20,000 loan at a\\n7 percent interest rate from Bigbank to attend college. In ten years, the loan willcome due. After his debt has compounded for ten years at 7 percent, Sam will oweBigbank $40,000. The real value of this debt will depend on inflation over thedecade. If Sam is lucky, the economy will have a hyperinflation. In this case, wagesand prices will rise so high that Sam will be able to pay the $40,000 debt out ofpocket change. By contrast, if the economy goes through a major deflation, thenwages and prices will fall, and Sam will find the $40,000 debt a greater burdenthan he anticipated.\\nThis example shows that unexpected changes in prices redistribute wealth\\namong debtors and creditors. A hyperinflation enriches Sam at the expense of Big-bank because it diminishes the real value of the debt; Sam can repay the loan inless valuable dollars than he anticipated. Deflation enriches Bigbank at Sam’s ex-pense because it increases the real value of the debt; in this case, Sam has to repaythe loan in more valuable dollars than he anticipated. If inflation were predictable,then Bigbank and Sam could take inflation into account when setting the nominalinterest rate. (Recall the Fisher effect.) But if inflation is hard to predict, it imposesrisk on Sam and Bigbank that both would prefer to avoid.\\nThis cost of unexpected inflation is important to consider together with an-\\nother fact: Inflation is especially volatile and uncertain when the average rate of in-flation is high. This is seen most simply by examining the experience of differentcountries. Countries with low average inflation, such as Germany in the late twen-tieth century, tend to have stable inflation. Countries with high average inflation,such as many countries in Latin America, tend also to have unstable inflation.There are no known examples of economies with high, stable inflation. This rela-tionship between the level and volatility of inflation points to another cost of in-flation. If a country pursues a high-inflation monetary policy, it will have to bearnot only the costs of high expected inflation but also the arbitrary redistributionsof wealth associated with unexpected inflation.360 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nwealth. Most farmers in the western part of the country were debtors. Their\\ncreditors were the bankers in the east. When the price level fell, it caused thereal value of these debts to rise, which enriched the banks at the expense of thefarmers.\\nAccording to populist politicians of the time, the solution to the farmers’\\nproblem was the free coinage of silver. During this period, the United Stateswas operating with a gold standard. The quantity of gold determined themoney supply and, thereby, the price level. The free-silver advocates wantedsilver, as well as gold, to be used as money. If adopted, this proposal wouldhave increased the money supply, pushed up the price level, and reduced thereal burden of the farmers’ debts.\\nThe debate over silver was heated, and it was central to the politics of the\\n1890s. A common election slogan of the populists was “We Are Mortgaged. AllBut Our Votes.” One prominent advocate of free silver was William JenningsBryan, the Democratic nominee for president in 1896. He is remembered in partfor a speech at the Democratic party’s nominating convention in which he said,“You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. Youshall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.” Rarely since then have politi-cians waxed so poetic about alternative approaches to monetary policy.Nonetheless, Bryan lost the election to Republican William McKinley, and theUnited States remained on the gold standard.\\nL. Frank Baum, the author of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, was a\\nmidwestern journalist. When he sat down to write a story for children, he madethe characters represent protagonists in the major political battle of his time.Although modern commentators on the story differ somewhat in the inter-pretation they assign to each character, there is no doubt that the story high-lights the debate over monetary policy. Here is how economic historian HughRockoff, writing in the August 1990 issue of the Journal of Political Economy,\\ninterprets the story:\\nDOROTHY: Traditional American values\\nTOTO: Prohibitionist party, also called the\\nTeetotalers\\nSCARECROW: Farmers\\nTIN WOODSMAN: Industrial workers\\nCOWARDLY LION: William Jennings Bryan\\nMUNCHKINS: Citizens of the east\\nWICKED WITCH OF THE EAST: Grover Cleveland\\nWICKED WITCH OF THE WEST: William McKinley\\nWIZARD: Marcus Alonzo Hanna, chairman of the\\nRepublican party\\nOZ: Abbreviation for ounce of gold\\nYELLOW BRICK ROAD: Gold standard\\nIn the end of Baum’s story, Dorothy does find her way home, but it is not by just\\nfollowing the yellow brick road. After a long and perilous journey, she learnsthat the wizard is incapable of helping her or her friends. Instead, Dorothyfinally discovers the magical power of her silver slippers. (When the book wasmade into a movie in 1939, Dorothy’s slippers were changed from silver to ruby.\\nApparently, the Hollywood filmmakers were not aware that they were telling astory about nineteenth-century monetary policy.)\\nAlthough the populists lost the debate over the free coinage of silver, they\\ndid eventually get the monetary expansion and inflation that they wanted. In1898 prospectors discovered gold near the Klondike River in the CanadianYukon. Increased supplies of gold also arrived from the mines of South Africa.As a result, the money supply and the price level started to rise in the UnitedStates and other countries operating on the gold standard. Within 15 years,prices in the United States were back to the levels that had prevailed in the1880s, and farmers were better able to handle their debts.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and describe six costs of inflation.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis chapter discussed the causes and costs of inflation. The primary cause of in-\\nflation is simply growth in the quantity of money. When the central bank createsmoney in large quantities, the value of money falls quickly. To maintain stableprices, the central bank must maintain strict control over the money supply.\\nThe costs of inflation are more subtle. They include shoeleather costs, menu\\ncosts, increased variability of relative prices, unintended changes in tax liabilities,confusion and inconvenience, and arbitrary redistributions of wealth. Are thesecosts, in total, large or small? All economists agree that they become huge duringhyperinflation. But their size for moderate inflation—when prices rise by less than10 percent per year—is more open to debate.\\nAlthough this chapter presented many of the most important lessons about in-\\nflation, the discussion is incomplete. When the Fed reduces the rate of moneygrowth, prices rise less rapidly, as the quantity theory suggests. Yet as the economymakes the transition to this lower inflation rate, the change in monetary policy willhave disruptive effects on production and employment. That is, even though mon-etary policy is neutral in the long run, it has profound effects on real variables inCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 361\\nAN EARLY DEBATE OVER\\nMONETARY POLICY\\n362 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nthe short run.

Thiswould no longer be true if debt con-tracts were written in real, rather thannominal, terms. In 1997 the U.S. Trea-sury started issuing bonds with areturn indexed to the price level. Inthe following article, written a fewmonths before the policy was imple-mented, two prominent economistsdiscuss the merits of this policy.Inflation Fighters\\nfor the Long Term\\nBYJOHNY. C AMPBELL\\nANDROBERT J. S HILLER\\nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin an-\\nnounced on Thursday that the govern-ment plans to issue inflation-indexedbonds—that is, bonds whose interestand principal payments are adjustedupward for inflation, guaranteeing theirreal purchasing power in the future.\\nThis is a historic moment. Econo-\\nmists have been advocating suchbonds for many long and frustratingyears. Index bonds were first called forin 1822 by the economist JosephLowe. In the 1870s, they were cham-pioned by the British economist Wil-liam Stanley Jevons. In the early part ofthis century, the legendary IrvingFisher made a career of advocatingthem.\\nIn recent decades, economists of\\nevery political stripe—from MiltonFriedman to James Tobin, Alan Blinderto Alan Greenspan—have supportedthem. Yet, because there was littlepublic clamor for such an investment,the government never issued indexed\\nbonds.\\nLet’s hope this lack of interest\\ndoes not continue now that they willbecome available. The success of theindexed bonds depends on whether thepublic understands them—and buysthem. Until now, inflation has madegovernment bonds a risky investment.In 1966, when the inflation rate wasonly 3 percent, if someone had boughta 30-year government bond yielding5 percent, he would have expectedthat by now his investment would beworth 180 percent of its original value.However, after years of higher-than-expected inflation, the investment isworth only 85 percent of its originalvalue.\\nBecause inflation has been mod-\\nest in recent years, many people todayare not worried about how it will affecttheir savings. This complacency is dan-gerous: Even a low rate of inflation canseriously erode savings over long peri-ods of time.\\nImagine that you retire today with a\\npension invested in Treasury bondsthat pay a fixed $10,000 each year,\\nIN THE NEWS\\nHow to Protect Your Savings\\nfrom Inflation\\nN The overall level of prices in an economy adjusts to\\nbring money supply and money demand into balance.When the central bank increases the supply of money, itcauses the price level to rise. Persistent growth in thequantity of money supplied leads to continuinginflation.N The principle of monetary neutrality asserts that\\nchanges in the quantity of money influence nominalvariables but not real variables. Most economists believethat monetary neutrality approximately describes thebehavior of the economy in the long run. SummaryCHAPTER 16 MONEY GROWTH AND INFLATION 363\\nregardless of inflation. If there is no in-\\nflation, in 20 years the pension will havethe same purchasing power that it doestoday. But if there is an inflation rate ofonly 3 percent per year, in 20 yearsyour pension will be worth only $5,540in today’s dollars. Five percent inflationover 20 years will cut your purchasingpower to $3,770, and 10 percent willreduce it to a pitiful $1,390. Whichof these scenarios is likely? No oneknows. Inflation ultimately depends onthe people who are elected and ap-pointed as guardians of our moneysupply.\\nAt a time when Americans are liv-\\ning longer and planning for severaldecades of retirement, the insidious ef-fects of inflation should be of seriousconcern. For this reason alone, the cre-ation of inflation-indexed bonds, withtheir guarantee of a safe return overlong periods of time, is a welcome de-velopment.\\nNo other investment offers this\\nkind of safety. Conventional govern-ment bonds make payments that arefixed in dollar terms; but investorsshould be concerned about purchasingpower, not about the number of dollars\\nthey receive. Money market fundsmake dollar payments that increasewith inflation to some degree, sinceshort-term interest rates tend to risewith inflation. But many other factorsalso influence interest rates, so the realincome from a money market fund isnot secure.\\nThe stock market offers a high rate\\nof return on average, but it can fall aswell as rise. Investors should remem-ber the bear market of the 1970s aswell as the bull market of the 1980sand 1990s.\\nInflation-indexed government bonds\\nhave been issued in Britain for 15years, in Canada for five years, and inmany other countries, including Aus-tralia, New Zealand, and Sweden. InBritain, which has the world’s largest in-dexed-bond market, the bonds have of-fered a yield 3 to 4 percent higher thanthe rate of inflation. In the UnitedStates, a safe long-term return of thissort should make indexed bonds an im-portant part of retirement savings.\\nWe expect that financial insti-\\ntutions will take advantage of the newinflation-indexed bonds and offer in-\\nnovative new products. Indexed-bondfunds will probably appear first, but in-dexed annuities and even indexed mort-gages—monthly payments would beadjusted for inflation—should also be-come available. [\\nAuthor’s note: Since\\nthis article was written, some of theseindexed products have been intro-duced, but their use is not yet wide-spread.]\\nAlthough the Clinton administration\\nmay not get much credit for it today,the decision to issue inflation-indexedbonds is an accomplishment that histo-rians decades hence will single out forspecial recognition.\\nSOURCE :The New York Times, May 18, 1996, p. 19.\\nN A government can pay for some of its spending simply\\nby printing money. When countries rely heavily on this“inflation tax,” the result is hyperinflation.\\nN One application of the principle of monetary neutrality\\nis the Fisher effect. According to the Fisher effect, whenthe inflation rate rises, the nominal interest rate rises bythe same amount, so that the real interest rate remainsthe same.\\nN Many people think that inflation makes them poorer\\nbecause it raises the cost of what they buy. This view isa fallacy, however, because inflation also raises nominalincomes.N Economists have identified six costs of inflation:\\nshoeleather costs associated with reduced moneyholdings, menu costs associated with more frequentadjustment of prices, increased variability of relativeprices, unintended changes in tax liabilities due tononindexation of the tax code, confusion andinconvenience resulting from a changing unit ofaccount, and arbitrary redistributions of wealth betweendebtors and creditors. Many of these costs are largeduring hyperinflation, but the size of these costs formoderate inflation is less clear.364 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN\\nquantity theory of money, p. 344\\nnominal variables, p. 345real variables, p. 345classical dichotomy, p. 345monetary neutrality, p. 346\\nvelocity of money, p. 347quantity equation, p. 347inflation tax, p. 350Fisher effect, p. 352\\nshoeleather costs, p. 354menu costs, p. 356Key Concepts\\n1.

In all of these cases, you are participating not justin the U.S. economy but in economies around the world.\\nThere are clear benefits to being open to international trade: Trade allows peo-\\nple to produce what they produce best and to consume the great variety of goodsand services produced around the world. Indeed, one of the Ten Principles of Eco-\\nnomics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make everyone better off. Chap-\\nters 3 and 9 examined the gains from trade more fully. We learned thatinternational trade can raise living standards in all countries by allowing eachOPEN-ECONOMY\\nMACROECONOMICS:\\nBASIC CONCEPTS\\n369370 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\ncountry to specialize in producing those goods and services in which it has a com-\\nparative advantage.\\nSo far our development of macroeconomics has largely ignored the economy’s\\ninteraction with other economies around the world. For most questions in macro-economics, international issues are peripheral. For instance, when we discussedthe natural rate of unemployment in Chapter 14 and the causes of inflation inChapter 16, the effects of international trade could safely be ignored. Indeed, tokeep their analysis simple, macroeconomists often assume a closed economy —an\\neconomy that does not interact with other economies.\\nYet some new macroeconomic issues arise in an open economy —an economy\\nthat interacts freely with other economies around the world. This chapter and thenext one, therefore, provide an introduction to open-economy macroeconomics.We begin in this chapter by discussing the key macroeconomic variables that de-scribe an open economy’s interactions in world markets. You may have noticedmention of these variables—exports, imports, the trade balance, and exchangerates—when reading the newspaper or watching the nightly news. Our first job isto understand what these data mean. In the next chapter we develop a model toexplain how these variables are determined and how they are affected by variousgovernment policies.\\nTHE INTERNATIONAL FLOWS\\nOF GOODS AND CAPITAL\\nAn open economy interacts with other economies in two ways: It buys and sells\\ngoods and services in world product markets, and it buys and sells capital assetsin world financial markets. Here we discuss these two activities and the close rela-tionship between them.\\nTHE FLOW OF GOODS: EXPORTS,IMPORTS,\\nAND NET EXPORTS\\nAs we first noted in Chapter 3, exports are domestically produced goods and ser-\\nvices that are sold abroad, and imports are foreign-produced goods and services\\nthat are sold domestically. When Boeing, the U.S. aircraft manufacturer, builds aplane and sells it to Air France, the sale is an export for the United States and animport for France. When Volvo, the Swedish car manufacturer, makes a car andsells it to a U.S. resident, the sale is an import for the United States and an exportfor Sweden.\\nThe net exports of any country are the value of its exports minus the value of\\nits imports. The Boeing sale raises U.S. net exports, and the Volvo sale reduces U.S.net exports. Because net exports tell us whether a country is, in total, a seller or abuyer in world markets for goods and services, net exports are also called thetrade balance. If net exports are positive, exports are greater than imports, indi-\\ncating that the country sells more goods and services abroad than it buys fromother countries. In this case, the country is said to run a trade surplus.

In the 1950s exports of goodsand services averaged less than 5 percent of GDP . Today they are more thantwice that level and still rising. Imports of goods and services have risen by asimilar amount.exports are negative, exports are less than imports, indicating that the country sellsfewer goods and services abroad than it buys from other countries. In this case, thecountry is said to run a trade deficit. If net exports are zero, its exports and im-\\nports are exactly equal, and the country is said to have balanced trade.\\nIn the next chapter we develop a theory that explains an economy’s trade bal-\\nance, but even at this early stage it is easy to think of many factors that might in-fluence a country’s exports, imports, and net exports. Those factors include thefollowing:\\nNThe tastes of consumers for domestic and foreign goods\\nNThe prices of goods at home and abroad\\nNThe exchange rates at which people can use domestic currency to buy foreign\\ncurrencies\\nNThe incomes of consumers at home and abroad\\nNThe cost of transporting goods from country to country\\nNThe policies of the government toward international trade\\nAs these variables change over time, so does the amount of international trade.\\n“But we’re not just talking about buying a car—we’re talking\\nabout confronting this country’s trade deficit with Japan.”\\ntrade deficit\\nan excess of imports over exports\\nbalanced trade\\na situation in which exportsequal imports372 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nThis increase in international trade is partly due to improvements in trans-\\nportation. In 1950 the average merchant ship carried less than 10,000 tons ofcargo; today, many ships carry more than 100,000 tons. The long-distance jetwas introduced in 1958, and the wide-body jet in 1967, making air transport farcheaper. Because of these developments, goods that once had to be produced lo-cally can now be traded around the world. Cut flowers, for instance, are nowgrown in Israel and flown to the United States to be sold. Fresh fruits and veg-etables that can grow only in summer can now be consumed in winter as well,because they can be shipped to the United States from countries in the southernhemisphere.\\nThe increase in international trade has also been influenced by advances in\\ntelecommunications, which have allowed businesses to reach overseas cus-tomers more easily. For example, the first transatlantic telephone cable was notlaid until 1956. As recently as 1966, the technology allowed only 138 simultane-ous conversations between North America and Europe. Today, communicationssatellites permit more than 1 million conversations to occur at the same time.\\nTechnological progress has also fostered international trade by changing the\\nkinds of goods that economies produce. When bulky raw materials (such assteel) and perishable goods (such as foodstuffs) were a large part of the world’soutput, transporting goods was often costly and sometimes impossible. By con-trast, goods produced with modern technology are often light and easy to trans-port. Consumer electronics, for instance, have low weight for every dollar ofvalue, which makes them easy to produce in one country and sell in another. Aneven more extreme example is the film industry. Once a studio in Hollywoodmakes a movie, it can send copies of the film around the world at almost zerocost. And, indeed, movies are a major export of the United States.\\nThe government’s trade policies have also been a factor in increasing inter-\\nnational trade. As we discussed in Chapters 3 and 9, economists have long be-lieved that free trade between countries is mutually beneficial. Over time,policymakers around the world have come to accept these conclusions. Inter-national agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement(NAFTA) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), have grad-ually lowered trade barriers, such as tariffs and import quotas. The pattern of\\nINTERNATIONAL TRADE IS\\nINCREASINGLY IMPORTANTFOR THE\\nU.S. ECONOMY .\\nCHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 373\\nincreasing trade illustrated in Figure 17-1 is a phenomenon that most econo-\\nmists and policymakers endorse and encourage.\\nTHE FLOW OF CAPITAL: NET FOREIGN INVESTMENT\\nSo far we have been discussing how residents of an open economy participate inworld markets for goods and services. In addition, residents of an open economyparticipate in world financial markets. A U.S. resident with $20,000 could use thatmoney to buy a car from Toyota, but he could instead use that money to buy stockin the Toyota corporation. The first transaction would represent a flow of goods,whereas the second would represent a flow of capital.\\nThe term net foreign investment refers to the purchase of foreign assets by\\ndomestic residents minus the purchase of domestic assets by foreigners. When aU.S. resident buys stock in Telmex, the Mexican phone company, the purchaseraises U.S. net foreign investment. When a Japanese resident buys a bond issuedby the U.S. government, the purchase reduces U.S. net foreign investment.\\nRecall that foreign investment takes two forms. If McDonald’s opens up a fast\\nfood outlet in Russia, that is an example of foreign direct investment. Alternatively,\\nif an American buys stock in a Russian corporation, that is an example of foreign\\nportfolio investment. In the first case, the American owner is actively managing the\\ninvestment, whereas in the second case the American owner has a more passiverole. In both cases, U.S. residents are buying assets located in another country, soboth purchases increase U.S. net foreign investment.\\nWe develop a theory to explain net foreign investment in the next chapter.\\nHere, let’s consider briefly some of the more important variables that influence netforeign investment:\\nNThe real interest rates being paid on foreign assets\\nNThe real interest rates being paid on domestic assetsPercent\\nof GDP\\nExportsImports\\n051015\\n1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1990 1985 2000 1995Figure 17-1\\nTHEINTERNATIONALIZATION\\nOF THE U.S. E CONOMY .

(Recall that a bond is, in effect, an IOU ofthe issuer.) To make this decision, U.S. investors compare the real interest ratesoffered on the two bonds. The higher a bond’s real interest rate, the more attractiveit is. While making this comparison, however, U.S. investors must also take intoaccount the risk that one of these governments might default on its debt (that is,\\nnot pay interest or principal when it is due), as well as any restrictions that the\\nWHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT A FACTORY BEING\\nbuilt in Asia or Latin America, have you\\never wondered who is financing thatproject?

Then LatinAmerica heated up—that is, until theMexican peso went bust, which sentinvestors scurrying back to the PacificRim.

Net exports measure an imbalance between a country’s exports and itsimports. Net foreign investment measures an imbalance between the amount offoreign assets bought by domestic residents and the amount of domestic assetsbought by foreigners.\\nAn important but subtle fact of accounting states that, for an economy as a\\nwhole, these two imbalances must offset each other. That is, net foreign investment(NFI) always equals net exports ( NX):\\nNFI /H11005NX.\\nThis equation holds because every transaction that affects one side of this equation\\nmust also affect the other side by exactly the same amount. This equation is anidentity —an equation that must hold because of the way the variables in the equa-\\ntion are defined and measured.\\nTo see why this accounting identity is true, consider an example. Suppose that\\nBoeing, the U.S. aircraft maker, sells some planes to a Japanese airline. In this sale,a U.S. company gives planes to a Japanese company, and a Japanese companygives yen to a U.S. company. Notice that two things have occurred simultaneously.The United States has sold to a foreigner some of its output (the planes), and thissale increases U.S. net exports. In addition, the United States has acquired someforeign assets (the yen), and this acquisition increases U.S. net foreign investment.\\nAlthough Boeing most likely will not hold on to the yen it has acquired in this\\nsale, any subsequent transaction will preserve the equality of net exports and netforeign investment. For example, Boeing may exchange its yen for dollars with aU.S. mutual fund that wants the yen to buy stock in Sony Corporation, the Japan-ese maker of consumer electronics. In this case, Boeing’s net export of planesequals the mutual fund’s net foreign investment in Sony stock. Hence, NXand NFI\\nrise by an equal amount.\\nAlternatively, Boeing may exchange its yen for dollars with another U.S. com-\\npany that wants to buy computers from Toshiba, the Japanese computer maker. Inthis case, U.S. imports (of computers) exactly offset U.S. exports (of planes). Thesales by Boeing and Toshiba together affect neither U.S. net exports nor U.S. netforeign investment. That is, NXand NFI are the same as they were before these\\ntransactions took place.\\nThe equality of net exports and net foreign investment follows from the fact\\nthat every international transaction is an exchange. When a seller country transfersa good or service to a buyer country, the buyer country gives up some asset to payfor this good or service. The value of that asset equals the value of the good or ser-vice sold. When we add everything up, the net value of goods and services sold bya country ( NX) must equal the net value of assets acquired ( NFI).

Let’s therefore consider how these variablesare related to the international flows of goods and capital, as measured by netexports and net foreign investment. We can do this most easily with the help ofsome simple mathematics.\\nAs you may recall, the term net exports first appeared earlier in the book when\\nwe discussed the components of gross domestic product. The economy’s grossdomestic product ( Y) is divided among four components: consumption ( C),\\ninvestment ( I), government purchases ( G), and net exports ( NX). We write \\nthis as\\nY/H11005C/H11001I/H11001G/H11001NX.WILL THE WORLD ’SDEVELOPING COUN -\\ntries, such as those in Latin America,flood the world’s industrial countrieswith cheap exports while refusing toimport goods from the industrial coun-tries? Will the developing countries usethe world’s saving to finance invest-ment and growth, leaving the indus-trial countries with insufficient fundsfor their own capital accumulation?Some people fear that both of these out-comes might occur. But an accountingidentity, and economist Paul Krugman,tell us not to worry.Fantasy Economics\\nBYPAULKRUGMAN\\nReports by international organizationsare usually greeted with well deservedyawns. Occasionally, however, such areport is a leading indicator of a seachange in opinion.\\nA few weeks ago, the World Eco-\\nnomic Forum—which every year drawsan unmatched assemblage of the world’spolitical and business elite to its confer-ence in Davos, Switzerland—releasedits annual report on international compet-itiveness. The report made headlines be-cause it demoted Japan and declaredAmerica the world’s most competitiveeconomy.\\nThe revealing part of the report,\\nhowever, is not its more or less mean-ingless competitiveness rankings but itsintroduction, which offers what seems tobe a very clear vision of the global eco-nomic future.That vision, shared by many power-\\nful people, is compelling and alarming. Itis also nonsense. And the fact that thisnonsense is being taken seriously bymany people who believe themselves tobe sophisticated about economics is it-self an ominous portent for the worldeconomy.\\nThe report finds that the spread\\nof modern technology to newly in-dustrializing nations is deindustrializinghigh-wage nations: Capital is flowing tothe Third World and low-cost produc-ers in these countries are floodingworld markets with cheap manufacturedgoods.\\nThe report predicts that these\\ntrends will accelerate, that service jobswill soon begin to follow the lost jobs inmanufacturing and that the future of thehigh-wage nations offers a bleak choicebetween declining wages and rising un-employment.\\nThis vision resonates with many\\npeople. Yet as a description of what has\\nIN THE NEWS\\nFlows between \\nthe Developing South\\nand the Industrial NorthCHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 377\\nTotal expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services is the sum of\\nexpenditure on consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports.Because each dollar of expenditure is placed into one of these four components,this equation is an accounting identity: It must be true because of the way the vari-ables are defined and measured.\\nRecall that national saving is the income of the nation that is left after paying\\nfor current consumption and government purchases.

But todaythese exports absorb only about 1 per-cent of First World income. Moreover,Third World nations have also increasedtheir imports.\\nOverall, the effect of Third World\\ngrowth on the number of industrial jobsin Western nations has been minimal:Growing exports to the newly industrial-izing countries have created about asmany jobs as growing imports havedisplaced.\\nWhat about capital flows? The num-\\nbers sound impressive. Last year, $24billion flowed to Mexico, $11 billion toChina. The total movement of capitalfrom advanced to developing nationswas about $60 billion. But though thissounds like a lot, it is pocket change in aworld economy that invests more than$4 trillion a year.In other words, if the vision of a\\nWestern economy battered by low-wagecompetition is meant to describe today’sworld, it is a fantasy with hardly any ba-sis in reality.\\nEven if the vision does not describe\\nthe present, might it describe the future?Well, growing exports of manufacturedgoods from South to North will lead to anet loss of northern industrial jobs only ifthey are not matched by growth in ex-ports from North to South.\\nThe authors of the report evidently\\nenvision a future of large-scale ThirdWorld trade surpluses. But it is an un-avoidable fact of accounting that a coun-try that runs a trade surplus must alsobe a net investor in other countries. Solarge-scale deindustrialization can takeplace only if low-wage nations are majorexporters of capital to high-wage na-tions. This seems unlikely. In any case, itcontradicts the rest of the story, whichpredicts huge capital flows into low-wagenations.Thus, the vision offered by the\\nworld competitiveness report conflictsnot only with the facts but with itself. Yetit is a vision that a growing number of theworld’s most influential men and womenseem to share. That is a dangeroustrend.\\nNot everyone who worries about\\nlow-wage competition is a protectionist.Indeed, the authors of the world compet-itiveness report would surely claim to bechampions of free trade. Nonetheless,the fact that such ideas have become re-spectable . . . suggests that the intellec-tual consensus that has kept world traderelatively free, and that has allowed hun-dreds of millions of people in the ThirdWorld to get their first taste of prosper-ity, may be unraveling.\\nSOURCE :The New York Times, September 26, 1994,\\np. A17.378 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nCASE STUDY ARE U.S. TRADE DEFICITS \\nA NATIONAL PROBLEM?\\nYou may have heard the press call the United States “the world’s largest\\ndebtor.” The nation earned that description by borrowing heavily in world fi-nancial markets during the 1980s and 1990s to finance large trade deficits. Whydid the United States do this, and should this event give Americans reason toworry?\\nTo answer these questions, let’s see what these macroeconomic accounting\\nidentities tell us about the U.S. economy. Panel (a) of Figure 17-2 shows nationalsaving and domestic investment as a percentage of GDP since 1960. Panel (b)shows net foreign investment as a percentage of GDP . Notice that, as the identi-ties require, net foreign investment always equals national saving minus do-mestic investment.\\nThe figure shows a dramatic change beginning in the early 1980s. Before\\n1980, national saving and domestic investment were very close, and so net for-eign investment was small. Yet after 1980, national saving fell dramatically, inpart because of increased government budget deficits and in part because of afall in private saving. Because this fall in saving did not coincide with a similarfall in domestic investment, net foreign investment became a large negativenumber, indicating that foreigners were buying more assets in the United Statesthan Americans were buying abroad. Put simply, the United States was goinginto debt.\\nAs we have seen, accounting identities require that net exports must equal\\nnet foreign investment. Thus, when net foreign investment became negative,net exports became negative as well. The United States ran a trade deficit:This equation shows that a nation’s saving must equal its domestic investmentplus its net foreign investment. In other words, when U.S. citizens save a dollar oftheir income for the future, that dollar can be used to finance accumulation of do-mestic capital or it can be used to finance the purchase of capital abroad.\\nThis equation should look somewhat familiar. Earlier in the book, when we\\nanalyzed the role of the financial system, we considered this identity for the spe-cial case of a closed economy. In a closed economy, net foreign investment is zero(NFI /H110050), so saving equals investment ( S/H11005I). By contrast, an open economy has\\ntwo uses for its saving: domestic investment and net foreign investment.\\nAs before, we can view the financial system as standing between the two sides\\nof this identity. For example, suppose the Smith family decides to save some of itsincome for retirement. This decision contributes to national saving, the left-handside of our equation. If the Smiths deposit their saving in a mutual fund, the mu-tual fund may use some of the deposit to buy stock issued by General Motors,which uses the proceeds to build a factory in Ohio. In addition, the mutual fundmay use some of the Smiths’ deposit to buy stock issued by Toyota, which uses theproceeds to build a factory in Osaka. These transactions show up on the right-hand side of the equation. From the standpoint of U.S. accounting, the GeneralMotors expenditure on a new factory is domestic investment, and the purchase ofToyota stock by a U.S. resident is net foreign investment. Thus, all saving in theU.S. economy shows up as investment in the U.S. economy or as U.S. net foreigninvestment.CHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 379\\nImports of goods and services exceeded exports. In 1998, the trade deficit was\\n$151 billion, or about 1.8 percent of GDP .\\nAre these trade deficits a problem for the U.S. economy? Most economists\\nbelieve that they are not a problem in themselves, but perhaps are a symptomof a problem—reduced national saving. Reduced national saving is potentiallya problem because it means that the nation is putting away less to provide forits future. Once national saving has fallen, however, there is no reason to de-plore the resulting trade deficits. If national saving fell without inducing a tradedeficit, investment in the United States would have to fall. This fall in invest-ment, in turn, would adversely affect the growth in the capital stock, labor\\nPercent\\nof GDP\\n20\\n18\\n1614\\n12\\n10\\n1960 1965 1995 1990 1985 1980 1975 1970National savingDomestic investment\\nPercent\\nof GDP\\n4\\n/H110024/H110023/H110022/H1100210123Net foreign\\ninvestment(a) National Saving and Domestic Investment (as a percentage of GDP)\\n(b) Net Foreign Investment (as a percentage of GDP)2000\\n1960 1965 1995 1990 1985 1980 1975 1970 2000Figure 17-2\\nNATIONAL SAVING ,\\nDOMESTIC INVESTMENT , AND\\nNETFOREIGN INVESTMENT .\\nPanel (a) shows national savingand domestic investment asa percentage of GDP .

Explain how\\nthey are related.\\nTHE PRICES FOR INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS:\\nREAL AND NOMINAL EXCHANGE RATES\\nSo far we have discussed measures of the flow of goods and services and the flow\\nof capital across a nation’s border. In addition to these quantity variables, macro-economists also study variables that measure the prices at which these interna-tional transactions take place. Just as the price in any market serves the importantrole of coordinating buyers and sellers in that market, international prices help co-ordinate the decisions of consumers and producers as they interact in world mar-kets. Here we discuss the two most important international prices—the nominaland real exchange rates.\\nNOMINAL EXCHANGE RATES\\nThe nominal exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the currency of\\none country for the currency of another. For example, if you go to a bank, youmight see a posted exchange rate of 80 yen per dollar. If you give the bank one U.S.dollar, it will give you 80 Japanese yen; and if you give the bank 80 Japanese yen,it will give you one U.S. dollar. (In actuality, the bank will post slightly differentprices for buying and selling yen. The difference gives the bank some profit for of-fering this service. For our purposes here, we can ignore these differences.)\\nAn exchange rate can always be expressed in two ways. If the exchange rate is\\n80 yen per dollar, it is also 1/80 ( /H110050.0125) dollar per yen. Throughout this book,\\nwe always express the nominal exchange rate as units of foreign currency per U.S.dollar, such as 80 yen per dollar.\\nIf the exchange rate changes so that a dollar buys more foreign currency, that\\nchange is called an appreciation of the dollar. If the exchange rate changes so that\\na dollar buys less foreign currency, that change is called a depreciation of the dol-\\nlar. For example, when the exchange rate rises from 80 to 90 yen per dollar, the dol-lar is said to appreciate. At the same time, because a Japanese yen now buys less ofthe U.S. currency, the yen is said to depreciate. When the exchange rate falls from80 to 70 yen per dollar, the dollar is said to depreciate, and the yen is said to ap-preciate.\\nAt times you may have heard the media report that the dollar is either\\n“strong” or “weak.” These descriptions usually refer to recent changes in the nom-inal exchange rate. When a currency appreciates, it is said to strengthen because it\\ncan then buy more foreign currency. Similarly, when a currency depreciates, it issaid to weaken.nominal exchange rate\\nthe rate at which a person can tradethe currency of one country for thecurrency of another\\nappreciation\\nan increase in the value of a currencyas measured by the amount of foreigncurrency it can buy\\ndepreciation\\na decrease in the value of a currencyas measured by the amount of foreigncurrency it can buyCHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 381\\nFor any country, there are many nominal exchange rates. The U.S. dollar can\\nbe used to buy Japanese yen, British pounds, French francs, Mexican pesos, and soon. When economists study changes in the exchange rate, they often use indexesthat average these many exchange rates. Just as the consumer price index turns themany prices in the economy into a single measure of the price level, an exchangerate index turns these many exchange rates into a single measure of the interna-tional value of the currency. So when economists talk about the dollar appreciatingor depreciating, they often are referring to an exchange rate index that takes intoaccount many individual exchange rates.\\nREAL EXCHANGE RATES\\nThe real exchange rate is the rate at which a person can trade the goods and ser-\\nvices of one country for the goods and services of another. For example, supposethat you go shopping and find that a case of German beer is twice as expensive asa case of American beer. We would then say that the real exchange rate is 1/2 caseof German beer per case of American beer. Notice that, like the nominal exchangerate, we express the real exchange rate as units of the foreign item per unit of thedomestic item. But in this instance the item is a good rather than a currency.\\nReal and nominal exchange rates are closely related. To see how, consider an\\nexample. Suppose that a bushel of American rice sells for $100, and a bushel ofJapanese rice sells for 16,000 yen. What is the real exchange rate between Americanand Japanese rice? To answer this question, we must first use the nominal ex-change rate to convert the prices into a common currency. If the nominal exchangerate is 80 yen per dollar, then a price for American rice of $100 per bushel is equiv-alent to 8,000 yen per bushel. American rice is half as expensive as Japanese rice.The real exchange rate is 1/2 bushel of Japanese rice per bushel of American rice.\\nWe can summarize this calculation for the real exchange rate with the follow-\\ning formula:\\nReal exchange rate /H11005 .\\nUsing the numbers in our example, the formula applies as follows:\\nReal exchange rate /H11005\\n/H11005\\n/H110051/2 bushel of Japanese rice per bushel of American rice.\\nThus, the real exchange rate depends on the nominal exchange rate and on the\\nprices of goods in the two countries measured in the local currencies.\\nWhy does the real exchange rate matter? As you might guess, the real ex-\\nchange rate is a key determinant of how much a country exports and imports.When Uncle Ben’s, Inc., is deciding whether to buy U.S. rice or Japanese rice to putinto its boxes, for example, it will ask which rice is cheaper. The real exchange rate\\n8,000 yen per bushel of American rice\\n16,000 yen per bushel of Japanese rice(80 yen per dollar) /H11003($100 per bushel of American rice)\\n16,000 yen per bushel of Japanese riceNominal exchange rate /H11003Domestic price\\nForeign pricereal exchange rate \\nthe rate at which a person can tradethe goods and services of one countryfor the goods and services of another382 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\ngives the answer. As another example, imagine that you are deciding whether to\\ntake a seaside vacation in Miami, Florida, or in Cancun, Mexico. You might askyour travel agent the price of a hotel room in Miami (measured in dollars), theprice of a hotel room in Cancun (measured in pesos), and the exchange rate be-tween pesos and dollars. If you decide where to vacation by comparing costs, youare basing your decision on the real exchange rate.\\nWhen studying an economy as a whole, macroeconomists focus on overall\\nprices rather than the prices of individual items. That is, to measure the real ex-change rate, they use price indexes, such as the consumer price index, which mea-sure the price of a basket of goods and services. By using a price index for a U.S.basket ( P), a price index for a foreign basket ( P*), and the nominal exchange rate\\nbetween the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies ( e), we can compute the overall real\\nexchange rate between the United States and other countries as follows:\\nReal exchange rate /H11005(e/H11003 P)/P*.\\nThis real exchange rate measures the price of a basket of goods and services avail-\\nable domestically relative to a basket of goods and services available abroad.\\nAs we examine more fully in the next chapter, a country’s real exchange rate is\\na key determinant of its net exports of goods and services. A depreciation (fall) inthe U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goods have become cheaper relative toforeign goods. This change encourages consumers both at home and abroad to buymore U.S. goods and fewer goods from other countries. As a result, U.S. exportsrise, and U.S. imports fall, and both of these changes raise U.S. net exports. Con-versely, an appreciation (rise) in the U.S. real exchange rate means that U.S. goodshave become more expensive compared to foreign goods, so U.S. net exports fall.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Define nominal exchange rate and real exchange rate, and\\nexplain how they are related. NIf the nominal exchange rate goes from 100 to\\n120 yen per dollar, has the dollar appreciated or depreciated?\\nA FIRST THEORY OF EXCHANGE-RATE\\nDETERMINATION: PURCHASING-POWER PARITY\\nExchange rates vary substantially over time. In 1970, a U.S. dollar could be used to\\nbuy 3.65 German marks or 627 Italian lira. In 1998, a U.S. dollar bought 1.76 Ger-man marks or 1,737 Italian lira. In other words, over this period the value of thedollar fell by more than half compared to the mark, while it more than doubledcompared to the lira.\\nWhat explains these large and opposite changes? Economists have developed\\nmany models to explain how exchange rates are determined, each emphasizingjust some of the many forces at work. Here we develop the simplest theory of ex-change rates, called purchasing-power parity. This theory states that a unit of any\\ngiven currency should be able to buy the same quantity of goods in all countries.Many economists believe that purchasing-power parity describes the forces thatdetermine exchange rates in the long run. We now consider the logic on which this\\npurchasing-power parity\\na theory of exchange rates whereby aunit of any given currency shouldbe able to buy the same quantityof goods in all countriesCHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 383\\nlong-run theory of exchange rates is based, as well as the theory’s implications and\\nlimitations.\\nTHE BASIC LOGIC OF PURCHASING-POWER PARITY\\nThe theory of purchasing-power parity is based on a principle called the law of one\\nprice. This law asserts that a good must sell for the same price in all locations. Oth-\\nerwise, there would be opportunities for profit left unexploited. For example, sup-pose that coffee beans sold for less in Seattle than in Boston. A person could buycoffee in Seattle for, say, $4 a pound and then sell it in Boston for $5 a pound, mak-ing a profit of $1 per pound from the difference in price. The process of taking ad-vantage of differences in prices in different markets is called arbitrage. In our\\nexample, as people took advantage of this arbitrage opportunity, they would in-crease the demand for coffee in Seattle and increase the supply in Boston. The priceof coffee would rise in Seattle (in response to greater demand) and fall in Boston(in response to greater supply). This process would continue until, eventually, theprices were the same in the two markets.\\nNow consider how the law of one price applies to the international market-\\nplace. If a dollar (or any other currency) could buy more coffee in the United Statesthan in Japan, international traders could profit by buying coffee in the UnitedStates and selling it in Japan. This export of coffee from the United States to Japan\\nSome of the currencies men-\\ntioned in this chapter, such asthe French franc, the Germanmark, and the Italian lira, are inthe process of disappearing.Many European nations havedecided to give up their na-tional currencies and start us-ing a new common currencycalled the euro. A newly formed\\nEuropean Central Bank, withrepresentatives from all of theparticipating countries, issues\\nthe euro and controls the quantity in circulation, much asthe Federal Reserve controls the quantity of dollars in theU.S. economy.\\nWhy are these countries adopting a common currency?\\nOne benefit of a common currency is that it makes tradeeasier. Imagine that each of the 50 U.S. states had a dif-ferent currency. Every time you crossed a state border youwould need to change your money and perform the kind ofexchange-rate calculations discussed in the text. This wouldbe inconvenient, and it might deter you from buying goodsand services outside your own state. The countries ofEurope decided\\nthat as theireconomies be-came more inte-grated, it wouldbe better toavoid this incon-venience.\\nThere are,\\nhowever, costsof choosing acommon cur-rency. If the na-tions of Europehave only onemoney, they canhave only one monetary policy. If they disagree about whatmonetary policy is best, they will have to reach some kind ofagreement, rather than each going its own way. Becauseadopting a single money has both benefits and costs, thereis debate among economists about whether Europe’s recentadoption of the euro was a good decision. Only time will tellwhat effect the decision will have.\\nFYI\\nThe Euro384 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nwould drive up the U.S. price of coffee and drive down the Japanese price. Con-\\nversely, if a dollar could buy more coffee in Japan than in the United States, traderscould buy coffee in Japan and sell it in the United States. This import of coffee intothe United States from Japan would drive down the U.S. price of coffee and driveup the Japanese price. In the end, the law of one price tells us that a dollar mustbuy the same amount of coffee in all countries.\\nThis logic leads us to the theory of purchasing-power parity. According to this\\ntheory, a currency must have the same purchasing power in all countries. That is,a U.S. dollar must buy the same quantity of goods in the United States and Japan,and a Japanese yen must buy the same quantity of goods in Japan and the UnitedStates. Indeed, the name of this theory describes it well. Parity means equality, and\\npurchasing power refers to the value of money. Purchasing-power parity states that a\\nunit of all currencies must have the same real value in every country.\\nIMPLICATIONS OF PURCHASING-POWER PARITY\\nWhat does the theory of purchasing-power parity say about exchange rates? It tellsus that the nominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries de-pends on the price levels in those countries. If a dollar buys the same quantity ofgoods in the United States (where prices are measured in dollars) as in Japan(where prices are measured in yen), then the number of yen per dollar must reflectthe prices of goods in the United States and Japan. For example, if a pound of cof-fee costs 500 yen in Japan and $5 in the United States, then the nominal exchangerate must be 100 yen per dollar (500 yen/$5 /H11005100 yen per dollar). Otherwise, the\\npurchasing power of the dollar would not be the same in the two countries.\\nTo see more fully how this works, it is helpful to use just a bit of mathematics.\\nSuppose that Pis the price of a basket of goods in the United States (measured in\\ndollars), P*is the price of a basket of goods in Japan (measured in yen), and eis the\\nnominal exchange rate (the number of yen a dollar can buy). Now consider thequantity of goods a dollar can buy at home and abroad. At home, the price level isP,so the purchasing power of $1 at home is 1/ P.Abroad, a dollar can be exchanged\\ninto eunits of foreign currency, which in turn have purchasing power e/P*.For the\\npurchasing power of a dollar to be the same in the two countries, it must be thecase that\\n1/P/H11005e/P*.\\nWith rearrangement, this equation becomes\\n1 /H11005eP/P*.\\nNotice that the left-hand side of this equation is a constant, and the right-hand side\\nis the real exchange rate. Thus, if the purchasing power of the dollar is always the same\\nat home and abroad, then the real exchange rate—the relative price of domestic and foreigngoods—cannot change.\\nTo see the implication of this analysis for the nominal exchange rate, we can\\nrearrange the last equation to solve for the nominal exchange rate:\\ne/H11005P*/P.CHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 385\\nCASE STUDY THE NOMINAL EXCHANGE RATE\\nDURING A HYPERINFLATION\\nMacroeconomists can only rarely conduct controlled experiments. Most often,\\nthey must glean what they can from the natural experiments that history givesthem. One natural experiment is hyperinflation—the high inflation that ariseswhen a government turns to the printing press to pay for large amounts of gov-ernment spending. Because hyperinflations are so extreme, they illustrate somebasic economic principles with clarity.\\nConsider the German hyperinflation of the early 1920s. Figure 17-3 shows\\nthe German money supply, the German price level, and the nominal exchangerate (measured as U.S. cents per German mark) for that period. Notice thatthese series move closely together. When the supply of money starts growingquickly, the price level also takes off, and the German mark depreciates. Whenthe money supply stabilizes, so does the price level and the exchange rate.\\nThe pattern shown in this figure appears during every hyperinflation. It\\nleaves no doubt that there is a fundamental link among money, prices, and thenominal exchange rate. The quantity theory of money discussed in the previouschapter explains how the money supply affects the price level. The theory ofpurchasing-power parity discussed here explains how the price level affects thenominal exchange rate.That is, the nominal exchange rate equals the ratio of the foreign price level (mea-sured in units of the foreign currency) to the domestic price level (measured inunits of the domestic currency). According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, the\\nnominal exchange rate between the currencies of two countries must reflect the differentprice levels in those countries.\\nA key implication of this theory is that nominal exchange rates change when\\nprice levels change. As we saw in the preceding chapter, the price level in anycountry adjusts to bring the quantity of money supplied and the quantity ofmoney demanded into balance. Because the nominal exchange rate depends onthe price levels, it also depends on the money supply and money demand in eachcountry. When a central bank in any country increases the money supply andcauses the price level to rise, it also causes that country’s currency to depreciaterelative to other currencies in the world. In other words, when the central bank prints\\nlarge quantities of money, that money loses value both in terms of the goods and services itcan buy and in terms of the amount of other currencies it can buy.\\nWe can now answer the question that began this section: Why has the U.S. dol-\\nlar lost value compared to the German mark and gained value compared to theItalian lira? The answer is that Germany has pursued a less inflationary monetarypolicy than the United States, and Italy has pursued a more inflationary monetarypolicy. From 1970 to 1998, inflation in the United States was 5.3 percent per year.By contrast, inflation was 3.5 percent in Germany, and 9.6 percent in Italy. As U.S.prices rose relative to German prices, the value of the dollar fell relative to themark. Similarly, as U.S. prices fell relative to Italian prices, the value of the dollarrose relative to the lira.386 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nLIMITATIONS OF PURCHASING-POWER PARITY\\nPurchasing-power parity provides a simple model of how exchange rates are de-\\ntermined. For understanding many economic phenomena, the theory works well.In particular, it can explain many long-term trends, such as the depreciation of theU.S. dollar against the German mark and the appreciation of the U.S. dollaragainst the Italian lira. It can also explain the major changes in exchange rates thatoccur during hyperinflations.\\nYet the theory of purchasing-power parity is not completely accurate. That is,\\nexchange rates do not always move to ensure that a dollar has the same real valuein all countries all the time. There are two reasons why the theory of purchasing-power parity does not always hold in practice.\\nThe first reason is that many goods are not easily traded. Imagine, for instance,\\nthat haircuts are more expensive in Paris than in New York. International travelersmight avoid getting their haircuts in Paris, and some haircutters might move fromNew York to Paris. Yet such arbitrage would probably be too limited to eliminatethe differences in prices. Thus, the deviation from purchasing-power parity mightpersist, and a dollar (or franc) would continue to buy less of a haircut in Paris thanin New York.\\nThe second reason that purchasing-power parity does not always hold is that\\neven tradable goods are not always perfect substitutes when they are produced indifferent countries. For example, some consumers prefer German beer, and othersprefer American beer. Moreover, consumer tastes for beer change over time. If Ger-man beer suddenly becomes more popular, the increase in demand will drive up10,000,000,0001,000,000,000,000,000\\n100,000\\n1\\n.00001\\n.0000000001\\n1921 1922 1923 1924Exchange rateMoney supply\\nPrice level\\n1925Indexes\\n(Jan. 1921 /H11005 100)Figure 17-3\\nMONEY , PRICES , AND THE\\nNOMINAL EXCHANGE RATE\\nDURING THE GERMAN\\nHYPERINFLATION .

Sargent,\\n“The End of Four Big Inflations,” in RobertHall, ed., Inflation (Chicago: University of\\nChicago Press, 1983), pp. 41–93.CHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 387\\nCASE STUDY THE HAMBURGER STANDARD\\nWhen economists apply the theory of purchasing-power parity to explain ex-\\nchange rates, they need data on the prices of a basket of goods available in dif-ferent countries. One analysis of this sort is conducted by The Economist, an\\ninternational newsmagazine. The magazine occasionally collects data on a bas-ket of goods consisting of “two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese,pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun.” It’s called the “Big Mac” and is sold byMcDonald’s around the world.\\nOnce we have the prices of Big Macs in two countries denominated in the\\nlocal currencies, we can compute the exchange rate predicted by the theory ofpurchasing-power parity. The predicted exchange rate is the one that makes thecost of the Big Mac the same in the two countries. For instance, if the price of aBig Mac is $2 in the United States and 200 yen in Japan, purchasing-power par-ity would predict an exchange rate of 100 yen per dollar.\\nHow well does purchasing-power parity work when applied using Big Mac\\nprices? Here are some examples from an Economist article published on April 3,\\n1999, when the price of a Big Mac was $2.43 in the United States:\\nPRICE OF PREDICTED ACTUAL\\nCOUNTRY A BIGMAC EXCHANGE RATE EXCHANGE RATE\\nItaly 4,500 lira 1,852 lira/$ 1,799 lira/$\\nJapan 294 yen 121 yen/$ 120 yen/$Russia 33.5 rubles 13.8 rubles/$ 24.7 rubles/$Germany 4.95 marks 2.04 marks/$ 1.82 marks/$Brazil 2.95 reals 1.21 reals/$ 1.73 reals/$Britain 1.90 pounds 0.78 pound/$ 0.62 pound/$\\nYou can see that the predicted and actual exchange rates are not exactly the\\nsame. After all, international arbitrage in Big Macs is not easy. Yet the twoexchange rates are usually in the same ballpark. Purchasing-power parity is notthe price of German beer. As a result, a dollar (or a mark) might then buy morebeer in the United States than in Germany. But despite this difference in prices inthe two markets, there might be no opportunity for profitable arbitrage becauseconsumers do not view the two beers as equivalent.\\nThus, both because some goods are not tradable and because some tradable\\ngoods are not perfect substitutes with their foreign counterparts, purchasing-power parity is not a perfect theory of exchange-rate determination. For these rea-sons, real exchange rates fluctuate over time. Nonetheless, the theory ofpurchasing-power parity does provide a useful first step in understanding ex-change rates. The basic logic is persuasive: As the real exchange rate drifts from thelevel predicted by purchasing-power parity, people have greater incentive to movegoods across national borders. Even if the forces of purchasing-power parity donot completely fix the real exchange rate, they provide a reason to expect thatchanges in the real exchange rate are most often small or temporary. As a result,large and persistent movements in nominal exchange rates typically reflectchanges in price levels at home and abroad.\\nINT H E UNITED STATESTHE PRICE OF\\nABIGMAC IS $2.43; INJAPAN IT IS\\n294 YEN.388 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\na precise theory of exchange rates, but it often provides a reasonable first\\napproximation.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Over the past 20 years, Spain has had high inflation, and\\nJapan has had low inflation. What do you predict has happened to the numberof Spanish pesetas a person can buy with a Japanese yen?\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe purpose of this chapter has been to develop some basic concepts that macro-economists use to study open economies. You should now understand why a na-tion’s net exports must equal its net foreign investment, and why national savingmust equal domestic investment plus net foreign investment. You should also un-derstand the meaning of the nominal and real exchange rates, as well as the impli-cations and limitations of purchasing-power parity as a theory of how exchangerates are determined.\\nThe macroeconomic variables defined here offer a starting point for analyzing\\nan open economy’s interactions with the rest of the world. In the next chapter wedevelop a model that can explain what determines these variables. We can thendiscuss how various events and policies affect a country’s trade balance and therate at which nations make exchanges in world markets.\\nN Net exports are the value of domestic goods and\\nservices sold abroad minus the value of foreign goodsand services sold domestically. Net foreign investmentis the acquisition of foreign assets by domestic residentsminus the acquisition of domestic assets by foreigners.Because every international transaction involves anexchange of an asset for a good or service, an economy’snet foreign investment always equals its net exports.\\nN An economy’s saving can be used either to finance\\ninvestment at home or to buy assets abroad. Thus,national saving equals domestic investment plus netforeign investment.\\nN The nominal exchange rate is the relative price of the\\ncurrency of two countries, and the real exchange rateis the relative price of the goods and services of twocountries. When the nominal exchange rate changes so\\nthat each dollar buys more foreign currency, the dollar issaid to appreciate or strengthen. When the nominal\\nexchange rate changes so that each dollar buys lessforeign currency, the dollar is said to depreciate or weaken.\\nN According to the theory of purchasing-power parity, a\\ndollar (or a unit of any other currency) should be able tobuy the same quantity of goods in all countries. Thistheory implies that the nominal exchange rate betweenthe currencies of two countries should reflect the pricelevels in those countries. As a result, countries withrelatively high inflation should have depreciatingcurrencies, and countries with relatively low inflationshould have appreciating currencies.\\nSummaryCHAPTER 17 OPEN-ECONOMY MACROECONOMICS: BASIC CONCEPTS 389\\nclosed economy, p. 370\\nopen economy, p. 370exports, p. 370imports, p. 370net exports, p. 370trade balance, p. 370\\ntrade surplus, p. 370trade deficit, p. 371balanced trade, p. 371net foreign investment, p. 373nominal exchange rate, p. 380\\nappreciation, p. 380depreciation, p. 380real exchange rate, p. 381purchasing-power parity, p. 382\\nKey Concepts\\n1.

That is, U.S. net exports have been negative. Al-though economists debate whether these trade deficits are a problem for the U.S.economy, the nation’s business community has a strong opinion. Many businessleaders claim that the trade deficits reflect unfair competition: Foreign firms are al-lowed to sell their products in U.S. markets, they contend, while foreign govern-ments impede U.S. firms from selling U.S. products abroad.\\nImagine that you are the president and you want to end these trade deficits.\\nWhat should you do? Should you try to limit imports, perhaps by imposing aquota on the import of cars from Japan? Or should you try to influence the nation’strade deficit in some other way?\\nTo understand what factors determine a country’s trade balance and how\\ngovernment policies can affect it, we need a macroeconomic theory of the openA MACROECONOMIC THEORY\\nOF THE OPEN ECONOMY\\n391392 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\neconomy. The preceding chapter introduced some of the key macroeconomic vari-\\nables that describe an economy’s relationship with other economies—includingnet exports, net foreign investment, and the real and nominal exchange rates. Thischapter develops a model that shows what forces determine these variables andhow these variables are related to one another.\\nTo develop this macroeconomic model of an open economy, we build on our\\nprevious analysis in two important ways. First, the model takes the economy’sGDP as given. We assume that the economy’s output of goods and services, asmeasured by real GDP , is determined by the supplies of the factors of productionand by the available production technology that turns these inputs into output.Second, the model takes the economy’s price level as given. We assume the pricelevel adjusts to bring the supply and demand for money into balance. In otherwords, this chapter takes as a starting point the lessons learned in Chapters 12 and16 about the determination of the economy’s output and price level.\\nThe goal of the model in this chapter is to highlight those forces that determine\\nthe economy’s trade balance and exchange rate. In one sense, the model is simple:It merely applies the tools of supply and demand to an open economy. Yet themodel is also more complicated than others we have seen because it involves look-ing simultaneously at two related markets—the market for loanable funds and themarket for foreign-currency exchange. After we develop this model of the openeconomy, we use it to examine how various events and policies affect the econ-omy’s trade balance and exchange rate. We will then be able to determine the gov-ernment policies that are most likely to reverse the trade deficits that the U.S.economy has experienced over the past decade.\\nSUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LOANABLE FUNDS\\nAND FOR FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE\\nTo understand the forces at work in an open economy, we focus on supply and de-\\nmand in two markets. The first is the market for loanable funds, which coordinatesthe economy’s saving and investment (including its net foreign investment). Thesecond is the market for foreign-currency exchange, which coordinates peoplewho want to exchange the domestic currency for the currency of other countries.In this section we discuss supply and demand in each of these markets. In the nextsection we put these markets together to explain the overall equilibrium for anopen economy.\\nTHE MARKET FOR LOANABLE FUNDS\\nWhen we first analyzed the role of the financial system in Chapter 13, we made thesimplifying assumption that the financial system consists of only one market,called the market for loanable funds. All savers go to this market to deposit their sav-\\ning, and all borrowers go to this market to get their loans. In this market, there isone interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of borrowing.CHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 393\\nTo understand the market for loanable funds in an open economy, the place to\\nstart is the identity discussed in the preceding chapter:\\nS /H11005 I /H11001 NFI\\nSaving /H11005Domestic investment /H11001Net foreign investment.\\nWhenever a nation saves a dollar of its income, it can use that dollar to finance the\\npurchase of domestic capital or to finance the purchase of an asset abroad. The twosides of this identity represent the two sides of the market for loanable funds. Thesupply of loanable funds comes from national saving ( S). The demand for loanable\\nfunds comes from domestic investment ( I) and net foreign investment ( NFI). Note\\nthat the purchase of a capital asset adds to the demand for loanable funds, regard-less of whether that asset is located at home or abroad. Because net foreign invest-ment can be either positive or negative, it can either add to or subtract from thedemand for loanable funds that arises from domestic investment.\\nAs we learned in our earlier discussion of the market for loanable funds, the\\nquantity of loanable funds supplied and the quantity of loanable funds demandeddepend on the real interest rate. A higher real interest rate encourages people tosave and, therefore, raises the quantity of loanable funds supplied. A higher inter-est rate also makes borrowing to finance capital projects more costly; thus, it dis-courages investment and reduces the quantity of loanable funds demanded.\\nIn addition to influencing national saving and domestic investment, the real\\ninterest rate in a country affects that country’s net foreign investment. To see why,consider two mutual funds—one in the United States and one in Germany—de-ciding whether to buy a U.S. government bond or a German government bond.The mutual funds would make this decision in part by comparing the real interestrates in the United States and Germany. When the U.S. real interest rate rises, theU.S. bond becomes more attractive to both mutual funds. Thus, an increase inthe U.S. real interest rate discourages Americans from buying foreign assets andencourages foreigners to buy U.S. assets. For both reasons, a high U.S. real interestrate reduces U.S. net foreign investment.\\nWe represent the market for loanable funds on the familiar supply-and-\\ndemand diagram in Figure 18-1. As in our earlier analysis of the financial system,the supply curve slopes upward because a higher interest rate increases the quan-tity of loanable funds supplied, and the demand curve slopes downward becausea higher interest rate decreases the quantity of loanable funds demanded. Unlikethe situation in our previous discussion, however, the demand side of the marketnow represents the behavior of both domestic investment and net foreign invest-ment. That is, in an open economy, the demand for loanable funds comes not onlyfrom those who want to borrow funds to buy domestic capital goods but also fromthose who want to borrow funds to buy foreign assets.\\nThe interest rate adjusts to bring the supply and demand for loanable funds\\ninto balance. If the interest rate were below the equilibrium level, the quantity ofloanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity demanded. The resultingshortage of loanable funds would push the interest rate upward. Conversely, if theinterest rate were above the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds sup-plied would exceed the quantity demanded. The surplus of loanable funds woulddrive the interest rate downward. At the equilibrium interest rate, the supply ofloanable funds exactly balances the demand. That is, at the equilibrium interest rate,394PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nthe amount that people want to save exactly balances the desired quantities of domestic in-\\nvestment and net foreign investment.\\nTHE MARKET FOR FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE\\nThe second market in our model of the open economy is the market for foreign-currency exchange. Participants in this market trade U.S. dollars in exchange forforeign currencies. To understand the market for foreign-currency exchange, webegin with another identity from the last chapter:\\nNFI /H11005 NX\\nNet foreign investment /H11005Net exports.\\nThis identity states that the imbalance between the purchase and sale of capital as-\\nsets abroad ( NFI) equals the imbalance between exports and imports of goods and\\nservices ( NX). When U.S. net exports are positive, for instance, foreigners are buy-\\ning more U.S. goods and services than Americans are buying foreign goods andservices. What are Americans doing with the foreign currency they are gettingfrom this net sale of goods and services abroad? They must be adding to theirholdings of foreign assets, which means U.S. net foreign investment is positive.Conversely, if U.S. net exports are negative, Americans are spending more on for-eign goods and services than they are earning from selling abroad; this tradedeficit must be financed by selling American assets abroad, so U.S. net foreign in-vestment is negative as well.\\nOur model of the open economy assumes that the two sides of this identity\\nrepresent the two sides of the market for foreign-currency exchange. Net foreigninvestment represents the quantity of dollars supplied for the purpose of buyingassets abroad. For example, when a U.S. mutual fund wants to buy a JapaneseEquilibrium\\nquantityQuantity of\\nLoanable FundsReal\\nInterest\\nRate\\nEquilibrium\\nreal interest\\nrateSupply of loanable funds\\n(from national saving)\\nDemand for loanable\\nfunds (for domestic\\ninvestment and net\\nforeign investment)Figure 18-1\\nTHEMARKET FOR\\nLOANABLE FUNDS . The interest\\nrate in an open economy, as in aclosed economy, is determined bythe supply and demand forloanable funds. National savingis the source of the supply ofloanable funds. Domesticinvestment and net foreigninvestment are the sources of thedemand for loanable funds. Atthe equilibrium interest rate,the amount that people want tosave exactly balances the amountthat people want to borrow forthe purpose of buying domesticcapital and foreign assets.CHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 395\\ngovernment bond, it needs to change dollars into yen, so it supplies dollars in the\\nmarket for foreign-currency exchange. Net exports represent the quantity of dol-lars demanded for the purpose of buying U.S. net exports of goods and services.For example, when a Japanese airline wants to buy a plane made by Boeing,it needs to change its yen into dollars, so it demands dollars in the market forforeign-currency exchange.\\nWhat price balances the supply and demand in the market for foreign-\\ncurrency exchange? The answer is the real exchange rate. As we saw in the pre-ceding chapter, the real exchange rate is the relative price of domestic and foreigngoods and, therefore, is a key determinant of net exports. When the U.S. real ex-change rate appreciates, U.S. goods become more expensive relative to foreigngoods, making U.S. goods less attractive to consumers both at home and abroad.As a result, exports from the United States fall, and imports into the United Statesrise. For both reasons, net exports fall. Hence, an appreciation of the real exchangerate reduces the quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currencyexchange.\\nFigure 18-2 shows supply and demand in the market for foreign-currency ex-\\nchange. The demand curve slopes downward for the reason we just discussed:A higher real exchange rate makes U.S. goods more expensive and reduces thequantity of dollars demanded to buy those goods. The supply curve is verticalbecause the quantity of dollars supplied for net foreign investment does notdepend on the real exchange rate. (As discussed earlier, net foreign investmentdepends on the real interest rate. When discussing the market for foreign-currencyexchange, we take the real interest rate and net foreign investment as given.)\\nThe real exchange rate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for dollars\\njust as the price of any good adjusts to balance supply and demand for that good.If the real exchange rate were below the equilibrium level, the quantity of dollarssupplied would be less than the quantity demanded. The resulting shortage of dol-lars would push the value of the dollar upward. Conversely, if the real exchangeEquilibrium\\nquantityQuantity of Dollars Exchanged\\ninto Foreign CurrencyReal\\nExchange\\nRate\\nEquilibrium\\nreal exchange\\nrateSupply of dollars\\n(from net foreign investment)\\nDemand for dollars\\n(for net exports)Figure 18-2\\nTHEMARKET FOR FOREIGN -\\nCURRENCY EXCHANGE . The real\\nexchange rate is determined bythe supply and demand forforeign-currency exchange. Thesupply of dollars to be exchangedinto foreign currency comes fromnet foreign investment. Becausenet foreign investment does notdepend on the real exchange rate,the supply curve is vertical. Thedemand for dollars comes fromnet exports. Because a lower realexchange rate stimulates netexports (and thus increases thequantity of dollars demanded topay for these net exports), thedemand curve is downwardsloping. At the equilibrium realexchange rate, the number ofdollars people supply to buyforeign assets exactly balancesthe number of dollars peopledemand to buy net exports.396 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nrate were above the equilibrium level, the quantity of dollars supplied would ex-\\nceed the quantity demanded. The surplus of dollars would drive the value of thedollar downward. At the equilibrium real exchange rate, the demand for dollars by for-\\neigners arising from the U.S. net exports of goods and services exactly balances the supplyof dollars from Americans arising from U.S. net foreign investment.\\nAt this point, it is worth noting that the division of transactions between “sup-\\nply” and “demand” in this model is somewhat artificial. In our model, net exportsare the source of the demand for dollars, and net foreign investment is the sourceof the supply. Thus, when a U.S. resident imports a car made in Japan, our modeltreats that transaction as a decrease in the quantity of dollars demanded (becausenet exports fall) rather than an increase in the quantity of dollars supplied. Simi-larly, when a Japanese citizen buys a U.S. government bond, our model treats thattransaction as a decrease in the quantity of dollars supplied (because net foreigninvestment falls) rather than an increase in the quantity of dollars demanded. Thisuse of language may seem somewhat unnatural at first, but it will prove usefulwhen analyzing the effects of various policies.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Describe the sources of supply and demand in the market\\nfor loanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange.\\nEQUILIBRIUM IN THE OPEN ECONOMY\\nSo far we have discussed supply and demand in two markets—the market forloanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. Let’s now considerhow these markets are related to each other.\\nAn alert reader of this book\\nmight ask: Why are we develop-ing a theory of the exchangerate here? Didn’t we already dothat in the preceding chapter?\\nAs you may recall, the pre-\\nceding chapter developed atheory of the exchange ratecalled purchasing-power parity.\\nThis theory asserts that a dol-lar (or any other currency) mustbuy the same quantity of goodsand services in every country.\\nAs a result, the real exchange rate is fixed, and all changesin the nominal exchange rate between two currencies reflectchanges in the price levels in the two countries.\\nThe model of the exchange rate developed here is re-\\nlated to the theory of purchasing-power parity. According tothe theory of purchasing-power parity, international trade re-sponds quickly to international price differences. If goodswere cheaper in one country than in another, they would be\\nexported from the first country and imported into the sec-ond until the price difference disappeared. In other words,the theory of purchasing-power parity assumes that net ex-ports are highly responsive to small changes in the real ex-change rate. If net exports were in fact so responsive, thedemand curve in Figure 18-2 would be horizontal.\\nThus, the theory of purchasing-power parity can be\\nviewed as a special case of the model considered here. Inthat special case, the demand curve for foreign-currency ex-change, rather than being downward sloping, is horizontal atthe level of the real exchange rate that ensures parity ofpurchasing power at home and abroad. That special case isa good place to start when studying exchange rates, but it isfar from the end of the story.\\nThis chapter, therefore, concentrates on the more real-\\nistic case in which the demand curve for foreign-currency ex-change is downward sloping. This allows for the possibilitythat the real exchange rate changes over time, as in fact itsometimes does in the real world.\\nFYI\\nPurchasing-\\nPower Parity as\\na Special Case\\nCHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 397\\nNET FOREIGN INVESTMENT:\\nTHE LINK BETWEEN THE TWO MARKETS\\nWe begin by recapping what we’ve learned so far in this chapter. We have been\\ndiscussing how the economy coordinates four important macroeconomic vari-ables: national saving ( S), domestic investment ( I), net foreign investment ( NFI),\\nand net exports ( NX). Keep in mind the following identities:\\nS/H11005I/H11001NFI\\nand\\nNFI /H11005NX.\\nIn the market for loanable funds, supply comes from national saving, demand\\ncomes from domestic investment and net foreign investment, and the real interestrate balances supply and demand. In the market for foreign-currency exchange,supply comes from net foreign investment, demand comes from net exports, andthe real exchange rate balances supply and demand.\\nNet foreign investment is the variable that links these two markets. In the mar-\\nket for loanable funds, net foreign investment is a piece of demand. A person whowants to buy an asset abroad must finance this purchase by borrowing in the mar-ket for loanable funds. In the market for foreign-currency exchange, net foreign in-vestment is the source of supply. A person who wants to buy an asset in anothercountry must supply dollars in order to exchange them for the currency of thatcountry.\\nThe key determinant of net foreign investment, as we have discussed, is the\\nreal interest rate. When the U.S. interest rate is high, owning U.S. assets is moreattractive, and U.S. net foreign investment is low. Figure 18-3 shows this negative\\n0 Net Foreign\\nInvestmentNet foreign investment\\nis negative.Net foreign investment\\nis positive.Real\\nInterest\\nRateFigure 18-3\\nHOWNETFOREIGN INVESTMENT\\nDEPENDS ON THE INTEREST RATE.\\nBecause a higher domestic realinterest rate makes domesticassets more attractive, it reducesnet foreign investment.

As before, national saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds.Domestic investment and net foreign investment are the source of the demand forloanable funds. The equilibrium real interest rate ( r\\n1) brings the quantity of loan-\\nable funds supplied and the quantity of loanable funds demanded into balance.\\nPanel (b) of the figure shows net foreign investment (taken from Figure 18-3).\\nIt shows how the interest rate from panel (a) determines net foreign investment.A higher interest rate at home makes domestic assets more attractive, and this inturn reduces net foreign investment. Therefore, the net-foreign-investment curvein panel (b) slopes downward.\\nPanel (c) of the figure shows the market for foreign-currency exchange (taken\\nfrom Figure 18-2). Because net foreign investment must be paid for with foreigncurrency, the quantity of net foreign investment from panel (b) determines the sup-ply of dollars to be exchanged into foreign currencies. The real exchange rate doesnot affect net foreign investment, so the supply curve is vertical. The demand fordollars comes from net exports. Because a depreciation of the real exchange rate in-creases net exports, the demand curve for foreign-currency exchange slopes down-ward. The equilibrium real exchange rate ( E\\n1) brings into balance the quantity of\\ndollars supplied and the quantity of dollars demanded in the market for foreign-currency exchange.\\nThe two markets shown in Figure 18-4 determine two relative prices—the real\\ninterest rate and the real exchange rate. The real interest rate determined in panel(a) is the price of goods and services in the present relative to goods and servicesin the future. The real exchange rate determined in panel (c) is the price of domes-tic goods and services relative to foreign goods and services. These two relativeprices adjust simultaneously to balance supply and demand in these two markets.As they do so, they determine national saving, domestic investment, net foreigninvestment, and net exports. In a moment, we will use this model to see howall these variables change when some policy or event causes one of these curvesto shift.\\nQUICK QUIZ: In the model of the open economy just developed, two\\nmarkets determine two relative prices. What are the markets? What are thetwo relative prices?\\nHOW POLICIES AND EVENTS\\nAFFECT AN OPEN ECONOMY\\nHaving developed a model to explain how key macroeconomic variables are de-\\ntermined in an open economy, we can now use the model to analyze how changesin policy and other events alter the economy’s equilibrium. As we proceed, keep inmind that our model is just supply and demand in two markets—the market forloanable funds and the market for foreign-currency exchange. When using themodel to analyze any event, we can apply the three steps outlined in Chapter 4.400 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nFirst, we determine which of the supply and demand curves the event affects.\\nSecond, we determine which way the curves shift. Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagrams to examine how these shifts alter the economy’s equilibrium.\\nGOVERNMENT BUDGET DEFICITS\\nWhen we first discussed the supply and demand for loanable funds earlier in thebook, we examined the effects of government budget deficits, which occur whengovernment spending exceeds government revenue. Because a government bud-get deficit represents negative public saving, it reduces national saving (the sum of\\npublic and private saving). Thus, a government budget deficit reduces the supplyof loanable funds, drives up the interest rate, and crowds out investment.\\nNow let’s consider the effects of a budget deficit in an open economy. First,\\nwhich curve in our model shifts? As in a closed economy, the initial impact of thebudget deficit is on national saving and, therefore, on the supply curve for loan-able funds. Second, which way does this supply curve shift? Again as in a closedeconomy, a budget deficit represents negative public saving, so it reduces national\\nsaving and shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left. This is shown asthe shift from S\\n1to S2in panel (a) of Figure 18-5.\\nOur third and final step is to compare the old and new equilibria. Panel (a)\\nshows the impact of a U.S. budget deficit on the U.S. market for loanable funds.With fewer funds available for borrowers in U.S. financial markets, the interestrate rises from r\\n1to r2to balance supply and demand. Faced with a higher interest\\nrate, borrowers in the market for loanable funds choose to borrow less. Thischange is represented in the figure as the movement from point A to point B alongthe demand curve for loanable funds. In particular, households and firms reducetheir purchases of capital goods. As in a closed economy, budget deficits crowd outdomestic investment.\\nIn an open economy, however, the reduced supply of loanable funds has addi-\\ntional effects. Panel (b) shows that the increase in the interest rate from r\\n1to r2re-\\nduces net foreign investment. [This fall in net foreign investment is also part of thedecrease in the quantity of loanable funds demanded in the movement from pointA to point B in panel (a).] Because saving kept at home now earns higher rates ofreturn, investing abroad is less attractive, and domestic residents buy fewer for-eign assets. Higher interest rates also attract foreign investors, who want to earnthe higher returns on U.S. assets. Thus, when budget deficits raise interest rates,both domestic and foreign behavior cause U.S. net foreign investment to fall.\\nPanel (c) shows how budget deficits affect the market for foreign-currency ex-\\nchange. Because net foreign investment is reduced, people need less foreign cur-rency to buy foreign assets, and this induces a leftward shift in the supply curvefor dollars from S\\n1to S2. The reduced supply of dollars causes the real exchange\\nrate to appreciate from E1to E2. That is, the dollar becomes more valuable com-\\npared to foreign currencies. This appreciation, in turn, makes U.S. goods more ex-pensive compared to foreign goods. Because people both at home and abroadswitch their purchases away from the more expensive U.S. goods, exports from theUnited States fall, and imports into the United States rise. For both reasons, U.S.net exports fall. Hence, in an open economy, government budget deficits raise real inter-\\nest rates, crowd out domestic investment, cause the dollar to appreciate, and push the tradebalance toward deficit.CHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 401\\nAn important example of this lesson occurred in the United States in the 1980s.\\nShortly after Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the fiscal policy ofthe U.S. federal government changed dramatically. The president and Congressenacted large cuts in taxes, but they did not cut government spending by nearly as(a) The Market for Loanable Funds (b) Net Foreign Investment\\nReal\\nInterest\\nRateReal\\nInterest\\nRate\\n(c) The Market for Foreign-Currency ExchangeQuantity of\\nDollarsQuantity of\\nLoanable FundsNet Foreign\\nInvestment\\nReal\\nExchange\\nRater1 r1\\nE1E2Demand\\nDemandr2 r2\\nNFI\\nS1 S2S2 S1\\nB\\nA1.

When the government runs a budget\\ndeficit, it reduces the supply of loanable funds from S1to S2in panel (a). The interest rate\\nrises from r1to r2to balance the supply and demand for loanable funds. In panel (b), the\\nhigher interest rate reduces net foreign investment. Reduced net foreign investment, inturn, reduces the supply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange from S\\n1to\\nS2in panel (c). This fall in the supply of dollars causes the real exchange rate to appreciate\\nfrom E1to E2. The appreciation of the exchange rate pushes the trade balance toward\\ndeficit.402 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nmuch, so the result was a large budget deficit. Our model of the open economy\\npredicts that such a policy should lead to a trade deficit, and in fact it did, as wesaw in a case study in the preceding chapter. The budget deficit and trade deficitduring this period were so closely related in both theory and practice that theyearned the nickname the twin deficits. We should not, however, view these twins as\\nidentical, for many factors beyond fiscal policy can influence the trade deficit.\\nTRADE POLICY\\nAtrade policy is a government policy that directly influences the quantity of\\ngoods and services that a country imports or exports. As we saw in Chapter 9,trade policy takes various forms. One common trade policy is a tariff, a tax on im-\\nported goods. Another is an import quota, a limit on the quantity of a good that can\\nbe produced abroad and sold domestically. Trade policies are common throughoutthe world, although sometimes they are disguised. For example, the U.S. govern-ment has often pressured Japanese automakers to reduce the number of cars theysell in the United States. These so-called “voluntary export restrictions” are not re-ally voluntary and, in essence, are a form of import quota.\\nLet’s consider the macroeconomic impact of trade policy. Suppose that the U.S.\\nauto industry, concerned about competition from Japanese automakers, convincesthe U.S. government to impose a quota on the number of cars that can be importedfrom Japan. In making their case, lobbyists for the auto industry assert that thetrade restriction would shrink the size of the U.S. trade deficit. Are they right? Ourmodel, as illustrated in Figure 18-6, offers an answer.\\nThe first step in analyzing the trade policy is to determine which curve shifts.\\nThe initial impact of the import restriction is, not surprisingly, on imports. Becausenet exports equal exports minus imports, the policy also affects net exports. Andbecause net exports are the source of demand for dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange, the policy affects the demand curve in this market.\\nThe second step is to determine which way this demand curve shifts. Because\\nthe quota restricts the number of Japanese cars sold in the United States, it reducesimports at any given real exchange rate. Net exports, which equal exports minusimports, will therefore risefor any given real exchange rate. Because foreigners\\nneed dollars to buy U.S. net exports, there is an increased demand for dollars inthe market for foreign-currency exchange. This increase in the demand for dollarsis shown in panel (c) of Figure 18-6 as the shift from D\\n1to D2.\\nThe third step is to compare the old and new equilibria. As we can see in panel\\n(c), the increase in the demand for dollars causes the real exchange rate to appreci-ate from E\\n1to E2. Because nothing has happened in the market for loanable funds\\nin panel (a), there is no change in the real interest rate. Because there is no changein the real interest rate, there is also no change in net foreign investment, shown inpanel (b). And because there is no change in net foreign investment, there can beno change in net exports, even though the import quota has reduced imports.\\nThe reason why net exports can stay the same while imports fall is explained\\nby the change in the real exchange rate: When the dollar appreciates in value in themarket for foreign-currency exchange, domestic goods become more expensiverelative to foreign goods. This appreciation encourages imports and discouragesexports—and both of these changes work to offset the direct increase in net exportstrade policy\\na government policy that directlyinfluences the quantity of goodsand services that a countryimports or exportsCHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 403\\ndue to the import quota. In the end, an import quota reduces both imports and\\nexports, but net exports (exports minus imports) are unchanged.\\nWe have thus come to a surprising implication: Trade policies do not affect the\\ntrade balance. That is, policies that directly influence exports or imports do not alter(a) The Market for Loanable Funds (b) Net Foreign Investment\\nReal\\nInterest\\nRateReal\\nInterest\\nRate\\n(c) The Market for Foreign-Currency ExchangeQuantity of\\nDollarsQuantity of\\nLoanable FundsNet Foreign\\nInvestment\\nReal\\nExchange\\nRater1 r1\\nSupplySupply\\nDemand\\nNFI\\nD2\\nD13.

When the U.S. government imposes a quota on the\\nimport of Japanese cars, nothing happens in the market for loanable funds in panel (a) orto net foreign investment in panel (b). The only effect is a rise in net exports (exportsminus imports) for any given real exchange rate. As a result, the demand for dollars in themarket for foreign-currency exchange rises, as shown by the shift from D\\n1to D2in panel\\n(c). This increase in the demand for dollars causes the value of the dollar to appreciatefrom E\\n1to E2. This appreciation of the dollar tends to reduce net exports, offsetting the\\ndirect effect of the import quota on the trade balance.404 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nnet exports. This conclusion seems less surprising if one recalls the accounting\\nidentity:\\nNX/H11005NFI /H11005S/H11002 I.\\nNet exports equal net foreign investment, which equals national saving minus\\ndomestic investment. Trade policies do not alter the trade balance because they donot alter national saving or domestic investment. For given levels of nationalsaving and domestic investment, the real exchange rate adjusts to keep the tradebalance the same, regardless of the trade policies the government puts in place.\\nAlthough trade policies do not affect a country’s overall trade balance, these\\npolicies do affect specific firms, industries, and countries. When the U.S. govern-ment imposes an import quota on Japanese cars, General Motors has less competi-tion from abroad and will sell more cars. At the same time, because the dollar hasappreciated in value, Boeing, the U.S. aircraft maker, will find it harder to competewith Airbus, the European aircraft maker. U.S. exports of aircraft will fall, and U.S.imports of aircraft will rise. In this case, the import quota on Japanese cars will in-crease net exports of cars and decrease net exports of planes. In addition, it willincrease net exports from the United States to Japan and decrease net exports fromthe United States to Europe. The overall trade balance of the U.S. economy, how-ever, stays the same.\\nThe effects of trade policies are, therefore, more microeconomic than macro-\\neconomic. Although advocates of trade policies sometimes claim (incorrectly) thatthese policies can alter a country’s trade balance, they are usually more motivatedby concerns about particular firms or industries. One should not be surprised, forinstance, to hear an executive from General Motors advocating import quotas forJapanese cars. Economists almost always oppose such trade policies. As we saw inChapters 3 and 9, free trade allows economies to specialize in doing what they dobest, making residents of all countries better off. Trade restrictions interfere withthese gains from trade and, thus, reduce overall economic well-being.\\nPOLITICAL INSTABILITY AND CAPITAL FLIGHT\\nIn 1994 political instability in Mexico, including the assassination of a prominentpolitical leader, made world financial markets nervous. People began to viewMexico as a much less stable country than they had previously thought. Theydecided to pull some of their assets out of Mexico in order to move these funds tothe United States and other “safe havens.” Such a large and sudden movement offunds out of a country is called capital flight. To see the implications of capital\\nflight for the Mexican economy, we again follow our three steps for analyzing achange in equilibrium, but this time we apply our model of the open economyfrom the perspective of Mexico rather than the United States.\\nConsider first which curves in our model capital flight affects. When investors\\naround the world observe political problems in Mexico, they decide to sell some oftheir Mexican assets and use the proceeds to buy U.S. assets. This act increasesMexican net foreign investment and, therefore, affects both markets in our model.Most obviously, it affects the net-foreign-investment curve, and this in turn influ-ences the supply of pesos in the market for foreign-currency exchange. In addition,because the demand for loanable funds comes from both domestic investment andnet foreign investment, capital flight affects the demand curve in the market forloanable funds.\\ncapital flight\\na large and sudden reduction inthe demand for assets locatedin a countryCHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 405\\nNow consider which way these curves shift. When net foreign investment in-\\ncreases, there is greater demand for loanable funds to finance these purchases.Thus, as panel (a) of Figure 18-7 shows, the demand curve for loanable funds shiftsto the right from D\\n1to D2. In addition, because net foreign investment is higher for\\n(a) The Market for Loanable Funds in Mexico (b) Mexican Net Foreign Investment\\nReal\\nInterest\\nRateReal\\nInterest\\nRate\\n(c) The Market for Foreign-Currency ExchangeQuantity of\\nPesosQuantity of\\nLoanable FundsNet Foreign\\nInvestment\\nReal\\nExchange\\nRater1 r1\\nD1D2\\nE2E1\\nDemandr2 r2\\nS1 S2Supply\\nNFI2 NFI11.

If people decide that Mexico is a risky place to keep\\ntheir savings, they will move their capital to safer havens such as the United States,resulting in an increase in Mexican net foreign investment. Consequently, the demand forloanable funds in Mexico rises from D\\n1to D2, as shown in panel (a), and this drives up the\\nMexican real interest rate from r1to r2. Because net foreign investment is higher for any\\ninterest rate, that curve also shifts to the right from NFI1to NFI2in panel (b). At the same\\ntime, in the market for foreign-currency exchange, the supply of pesos rises from S1to S2,\\nas shown in panel (c). This increase in the supply of pesos causes the peso to depreciate\\nfrom E1to E2, so the peso becomes less valuable compared to other currencies.406 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nany interest rate, the net-foreign-investment curve also shifts to the right from NFI1\\nto NFI2, as in panel (b).\\nTo see the effects of capital flight on the economy, we compare the old and new\\nequilibria. Panel (a) of Figure 18-7 shows that the increased demand for loanablefunds causes the interest rate in Mexico to rise from r\\n1to r2. Panel (b) shows that\\nMexican net foreign investment increases. (Although the rise in the interest ratedoes make Mexican assets more attractive, this development only partly offsetsthe impact of capital flight on net foreign investment.) Panel (c) shows that theincrease in net foreign investment raises the supply of pesos in the market forforeign-currency exchange from S\\n1to S2. That is, as people try to get out of Mexi-\\ncan assets, there is a large supply of pesos to be converted into dollars. This in-crease in supply causes the peso to depreciate from E\\n1to E2. Thus, capital flight from\\nMexico increases Mexican interest rates and decreases the value of the Mexican peso in themarket for foreign-currency exchange. This is exactly what was observed in 1994.\\nFrom November 1994 to March 1995, the interest rate on short-term Mexican gov-ernment bonds rose from 14 percent to 70 percent, and the peso depreciated invalue from 29 to 15 U.S. cents per peso.\\nAlthough capital flight has its largest impact on the country from which capi-\\ntal is fleeing, it also affects other countries. When capital flows out of Mexico intothe United States, for instance, it has the opposite effect on the U.S. economy as ithas on the Mexican economy. In particular, the rise in Mexican net foreign invest-ment coincides with a fall in U.S. net foreign investment. As the peso depreciatesin value and Mexican interest rates rise, the dollar appreciates in value and U.S. in-terest rates fall. The size of this impact on the U.S. economy is small, however, be-cause the economy of the United States is so large compared to that of Mexico.\\nThe events that we have been describing in Mexico could happen to any econ-\\nomy in the world, and in fact they do from time to time. In 1997, the world learnedthat the banking systems of several Asian economies, including Thailand, SouthKorea, and Indonesia, were at or near the point of bankruptcy, and this news in-duced capital to flee from these nations. In 1998, the Russian government de-faulted on its debt, inducing international investors to take whatever money theycould and run. In each of these cases of capital flight, the results were much as ourmodel predicts: rising interest rates and a falling currency.\\nCould capital flight ever happen in the United States? Although the U.S. econ-\\nomy has long been viewed as a safe economy in which to invest, political devel-opments in the United States have at times induced small amounts of capitalflight. For example, the September 22, 1995, issue of The New York Times reported\\nthat on the previous day, “House Speaker Newt Gingrich threatened to send theUnited States into default on its debt for the first time in the nation’s history, toforce the Clinton administration to balance the budget on Republican terms”(p. A1). Even though most people believed such a default was unlikely, the effectof the announcement was, in a small way, similar to that experienced by Mexico in1994. Over the course of that single day, the interest rate on a 30-year U.S. govern-ment bond rose from 6.46 percent to 6.55 percent, and the exchange rate fell from102.7 to 99.0 yen per dollar. Thus, even the stable U.S. economy is potentially sus-ceptible to the effects of capital flight.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Suppose that Americans decided to spend a smaller fraction\\nof their incomes. What would be the effect on saving, investment, interestrates, the real exchange rate, and the trade balance?CHAPTER 18 A MACROECONOMIC THEORY OF THE OPEN ECONOMY 407\\nCONCLUSION\\nInternational economics is a topic of increasing importance. More and more,\\nAmerican citizens are buying goods produced abroad and producing goods to besold overseas. Through mutual funds and other financial institutions, they borrowand lend in world financial markets. As a result, a full analysis of the U.S. economyrequires an understanding of how the U.S. economy interacts with other econo-mies in the world. This chapter has provided a basic model for thinking about themacroeconomics of open economies.\\nAlthough the study of international economics is valuable, we should be care-\\nful not to exaggerate its importance. Policymakers and commentators are oftenquick to blame foreigners for problems facing the U.S. economy. By contrast, econ-omists more often view these problems as homegrown. For example, politiciansoften discuss foreign competition as a threat to American living standards. Econo-mists are more likely to lament the low level of national saving. Low saving im-pedes growth in capital, productivity, and living standards, regardless of whetherthe economy is open or closed. Foreigners are a convenient target for politiciansbecause blaming foreigners provides a way to avoid responsibility without insult-ing any domestic constituency. Whenever you hear popular discussions of inter-national trade and finance, therefore, it is especially important to try to separatemyth from reality. The tools you have learned in the past two chapters should helpin that endeavor.\\nN To analyze the macroeconomics of open economies, two\\nmarkets are central—the market for loanable funds andthe market for foreign-currency exchange. In the marketfor loanable funds, the interest rate adjusts to balancethe supply of loanable funds (from national saving) andthe demand for loanable funds (from domesticinvestment and net foreign investment). In the marketfor foreign-currency exchange, the real exchange rateadjusts to balance the supply of dollars (for net foreigninvestment) and the demand for dollars (for netexports). Because net foreign investment is part of thedemand for loanable funds and provides the supply ofdollars for foreign-currency exchange, it is the variablethat connects these two markets.\\nN A policy that reduces national saving, such as a\\ngovernment budget deficit, reduces the supply ofloanable funds and drives up the interest rate. Thehigher interest rate reduces net foreign investment,which reduces the supply of dollars in the market forforeign-currency exchange. The dollar appreciates, and\\nnet exports fall.\\nN Although restrictive trade policies, such as tariffs or\\nquotas on imports, are sometimes advocated as a way toalter the trade balance, they do not necessarily have thateffect. A trade restriction increases net exports for agiven exchange rate and, therefore, increases thedemand for dollars in the market for foreign-currencyexchange. As a result, the dollar appreciates in value,making domestic goods more expensive relative toforeign goods. This appreciation offsets the initialimpact of the trade restriction on net exports.\\nN When investors change their attitudes about holding\\nassets of a country, the ramifications for the country’seconomy can be profound. In particular, politicalinstability can lead to capital flight, which tends toincrease interest rates and cause the currency todepreciate.\\nSummary408 PART SEVEN THE MACROECONOMICS OF OPEN ECONOMIES\\nTHIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES HOW CAPITAL IS\\nflowing from China into the United\\nStates.

Often,\\nsuch money was fleeing instability, asit was in Latin America in the 1980s,Russia in the 1990s, and Africa in bothdecades.\\nUsually, however, developing coun-\\ntries invest their capital in their owngrowing economies. And some Chineseofficials believe that’s what China shouldbe doing, too. One former Chinese cen-tral bank official calls it “scandalous”that a country of poor peasants is financ-ing investment of an industrialized powersuch as the United States.\\nOthers complain that China isn’t\\neven getting good returns on its invest-ments. It pays an average of 7 to 8 per-cent on its $130 billion foreign debt butearns only about 5 percent on the $140billion of its reserves invested abroad.That’s partly because yields on U.S.debt—widely considered the safest se-curities in the world—are relatively low.\\nBut China has good reasons to\\nsend some of its capital overseas. Its in-vestment in fixed assets as a percentageof its gross domestic product was an ex-\\ntraordinarily high 34 percent in 1996, thelatest year for which figures are avail-able. It’s doubtful that China could in-crease that ratio without wasting moneyor fueling inflation.

And thoseworkers, often allowed only one child onwhich to spend, are hitting their peaksaving years.

In most years, the production of\\ngoods and services rises. Because of increases in the labor force, increases in thecapital stock, and advances in technological knowledge, the economy can producemore and more over time. This growth allows everyone to enjoy a higher standardof living. On average over the past 50 years, the production of the U.S. economy asmeasured by real GDP has grown by about 3 percent per year.\\nIn some years, however, this normal growth does not occur. Firms find them-\\nselves unable to sell all of the goods and services they have to offer, so they cutback on production. Workers are laid off, unemployment rises, and factories areleft idle. With the economy producing fewer goods and services, real GDP andother measures of income fall.

What, if anything,\\ncan public policy do to prevent periods of falling incomes and rising unemploy-ment? When recessions and depressions occur, how can policymakers reduce theirlength and severity? These are the questions that we take up in this and the nexttwo chapters.\\nThe variables that we study in the coming chapters are largely those we have\\nalready seen. They include GDP , unemployment, interest rates, exchange rates,and the price level. Also familiar are the policy instruments of government spend-ing, taxes, and the money supply. What differs in the next few chapters is the timehorizon of our analysis. Our focus in the previous seven chapters has been on thebehavior of the economy in the long run. Our focus now is on the economy’s short-run fluctuations around its long-run trend.\\nAlthough there remains some debate among economists about how to analyze\\nshort-run fluctuations, most economists use the model of aggregate demand and\\naggregate supply. Learning how to use this model for analyzing the short-run effects\\nof various events and policies is the primary task ahead. This chapter introducesthe model’s two key pieces—the aggregate-demand curve and the aggregate-supply curve. After getting a sense of the overall structure of the model in thischapter, we examine the pieces of the model in more detail in the next twochapters.\\nTHREE KEY FACTS\\nABOUT ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nShort-run fluctuations in economic activity occur in all countries and in all times\\nthroughout history. As a starting point for understanding these year-to-year fluc-tuations, let’s discuss some of their most important properties.\\nFACT 1: ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS ARE\\nIRREGULAR AND UNPREDICTABLE\\nFluctuations in the economy are often called the business cycle. As this term sug-\\ngests, economic fluctuations correspond to changes in business conditions. Whenreal GDP grows rapidly, business is good. Firms find that customers are plentifuland that profits are growing. On the other hand, when real GDP falls, businesseshave trouble. In recessions, most firms experience declining sales and profits.\\nThe term business cycle is somewhat misleading, however, because it seems to\\nsuggest that economic fluctuations follow a regular, predictable pattern. In fact,economic fluctuations are not at all regular, and they are almost impossible to pre-dict with much accuracy. Panel (a) of Figure 19-1 shows the real GDP of the U.S.economy since 1965. The shaded areas represent times of recession. As the figureshows, recessions do not come at regular intervals. Sometimes recessions are closerecession\\na period of declining real incomesand rising unemployment\\ndepression\\na severe recessionCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 415\\nBillions of\\n1992 Dollars\\nReal GDP(a) Real GDP\\nBillions of\\n1992 Dollars\\nInvestment spending(b) Investment Spending\\nPercent of\\nLabor Force\\nUnemployment rate(c) Unemployment Rate3004005006007008009001,000$1,1002,5003,0003,5004,0004,5005,0005,5006,0006,500$7,000\\n0246810121965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 19951965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995\\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995Figure 19-1\\nAL OOK AT SHORT -RUN\\nECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS .\\nThis figure shows real GDP inpanel (a), investment spendingin panel (b), and unemploymentin panel (c) for the U.S. economyusing quarterly data since 1965.Recessions are shown as theshaded areas.

Sometimes the economy goes\\nmany years without a recession.\\nFACT 2: MOST MACROECONOMIC\\nQUANTITIES FLUCTUATE TOGETHER\\nReal GDP is the variable that is most commonly used to monitor short-run changes\\nin the economy because it is the most comprehensive measure of economic activ-ity. Real GDP measures the value of all final goods and services produced within agiven period of time. It also measures the total income (adjusted for inflation) ofeveryone in the economy.\\nIt turns out, however, that for monitoring short-run fluctuations, it does \\nnot really matter which measure of economic activity one looks at. Most macroeco-nomic variables that measure some type of income, spending, or production fluc-tuate closely together. When real GDP falls in a recession, so do personal income, corporate profits, consumer spending, investment spending, industrial production, retail sales, home sales, auto sales, and so on. Because recessions areeconomy-wide phenomena, they show up in many sources of macroeconomic data.\\nAlthough many macroeconomic variables fluctuate together, they fluctuate by\\ndifferent amounts. In particular, as panel (b) of Figure 19-1 shows, investmentspending varies greatly over the business cycle. Even though investment averagesabout one-seventh of GDP , declines in investment account for about two-thirds ofthe declines in GDP during recessions. In other words, when economic conditionsdeteriorate, much of the decline is attributable to reductions in spending on newfactories, housing, and inventories.\\n“You’re fired. Pass it on.”CHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 417\\nFACT 3: AS OUTPUT FALLS, UNEMPLOYMENT RISES\\nChanges in the economy’s output of goods and services are strongly correlated\\nwith changes in the economy’s utilization of its labor force. In other words, whenreal GDP declines, the rate of unemployment rises. This fact is hardly surprising:When firms choose to produce a smaller quantity of goods and services, they layoff workers, expanding the pool of unemployed.\\nPanel (c) of Figure 19-1 shows the unemployment rate in the U.S. economy\\nsince 1965. Once again, recessions are shown as the shaded areas in the figure. Thefigure shows clearly the impact of recessions on unemployment. In each of the re-cessions, the unemployment rate rises substantially. When the recession ends andreal GDP starts to expand, the unemployment rate gradually declines. The unem-ployment rate never approaches zero; instead, it fluctuates around its natural rateof about 5 percent.\\nQUICK QUIZ: List and discuss three key facts about economic fluctuations.\\nEXPLAINING SHORT-RUN\\nECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nDescribing the regular patterns that economies experience as they fluctuate over\\ntime is easy. Explaining what causes these fluctuations is more difficult. Indeed,compared to the topics we have studied in previous chapters, the theory of eco-nomic fluctuations remains controversial. In this and the next two chapters, we de-velop the model that most economists use to explain short-run fluctuations ineconomic activity.\\nHOW THE SHORT RUN DIFFERS FROM THE LONG RUN\\nIn previous chapters we developed theories to explain what determines most im-portant macroeconomic variables in the long run. Chapter 12 explained the leveland growth of productivity and real GDP . Chapter 13 explained how the real in-terest rate adjusts to balance saving and investment. Chapter 14 explained whythere is always some unemployment in the economy. Chapters 15 and 16 ex-plained the monetary system and how changes in the money supply affect theprice level, the inflation rate, and the nominal interest rate. Chapters 17 and 18 ex-tended this analysis to open economies in order to explain the trade balance andthe exchange rate.\\nAll of this previous analysis was based on two related ideas—the classical di-\\nchotomy and monetary neutrality. Recall that the classical dichotomy is the sepa-ration of variables into real variables (those that measure quantities or relativeprices) and nominal variables (those measured in terms of money). According toclassical macroeconomic theory, changes in the money supply affect nominal vari-ables but not real variables. As a result of this monetary neutrality, Chapters 12, 13,418 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nand 14 were able to examine the determinants of real variables (real GDP , the real\\ninterest rate, and unemployment) without introducing nominal variables (themoney supply and the price level).\\nDo these assumptions of classical macroeconomic theory apply to the world in\\nwhich we live? The answer to this question is of central importance to under-standing how the economy works: Most economists believe that classical theory de-\\nscribes the world in the long run but not in the short run. Beyond a period of several\\nyears, changes in the money supply affect prices and other nominal variables butdo not affect real GDP , unemployment, or other real variables. When studyingyear-to-year changes in the economy, however, the assumption of monetary neu-trality is no longer appropriate. Most economists believe that, in the short run, realand nominal variables are highly intertwined. In particular, changes in the moneysupply can temporarily push output away from its long-run trend.\\nTo understand the economy in the short run, therefore, we need a new model.\\nTo build this new model, we rely on many of the tools we have developed in pre-vious chapters, but we have to abandon the classical dichotomy and the neutralityof money.\\nTHE BASIC MODEL OF ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nOur model of short-run economic fluctuations focuses on the behavior of two vari-ables. The first variable is the economy’s output of goods and services, as mea-sured by real GDP . The second variable is the overall price level, as measured bythe CPI or the GDP deflator. Notice that output is a real variable, whereas the pricelevel is a nominal variable. Hence, by focusing on the relationship between thesetwo variables, we are highlighting the breakdown of the classical dichotomy.\\nWe analyze fluctuations in the economy as a whole with the model of aggre-\\ngate demand and aggregate supply, which is illustrated in Figure 19-2. On the ver-\\ntical axis is the overall price level in the economy. On the horizontal axis is theoverall quantity of goods and services. The aggregate-demand curve shows the\\nquantity of goods and services that households, firms, and the government wantto buy at each price level. The aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of\\ngoods and services that firms produce and sell at each price level. According tothis model, the price level and the quantity of output adjust to bring aggregate de-mand and aggregate supply into balance.\\nIt may be tempting to view the model of aggregate demand and aggregate\\nsupply as nothing more than a large version of the model of market demand andmarket supply, which we introduced in Chapter 4. Yet in fact this model is quitedifferent. When we consider demand and supply in a particular market—icecream, for instance—the behavior of buyers and sellers depends on the ability ofresources to move from one market to another. When the price of ice cream rises,the quantity demanded falls because buyers will use their incomes to buy prod-ucts other than ice cream. Similarly, a higher price of ice cream raises the quantitysupplied because firms that produce ice cream can increase production by hiringworkers away from other parts of the economy. This microeconomic substitution\\nfrom one market to another is impossible when we are analyzing the economy asa whole. After all, the quantity that our model is trying to explain—real GDP—measures the total quantity produced in all of the economy’s markets. To under-stand why the aggregate-demand curve is downward sloping and why themodel of aggregate\\ndemand andaggregate supplythe model that most economistsuse to explain short-runfluctuations in economic activityaround its long-run trend\\naggregate-demand curve\\na curve that shows the quantity ofgoods and services that households,firms, and the government want tobuy at each price level\\naggregate-supply curve\\na curve that shows the quantity ofgoods and services that firms chooseto produce and sell at each price levelCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 419\\naggregate-supply curve is upward sloping, we need a macroeconomic theory.\\nDeveloping such a theory is our next task.\\nQUICK QUIZ: How does the economy’s behavior in the short run differ\\nfrom its behavior in the long run? NDraw the model of aggregate demand\\nand aggregate supply. What variables are on the two axes?\\nTHE AGGREGATE-DEMAND CURVE\\nThe aggregate-demand curve tells us the quantity of all goods and services de-manded in the economy at any given price level. As Figure 19-3 illustrates, the aggregate-demand curve is downward sloping. This means that, other thingsequal, a fall in the economy’s overall level of prices (from, say, P\\n1to P2) tends to\\nraise the quantity of goods and services demanded (from Y1to Y2).\\nWHY THE AGGREGATE-DEMAND CURVE\\nSLOPES DOWNWARD\\nWhy does a fall in the price level raise the quantity of goods and services de-\\nmanded? To answer this question, it is useful to recall that GDP (which we denoteas Y) is the sum of consumption ( C), investment ( I), government purchases ( G),\\nand net exports ( NX):Equilibrium\\noutputQuantity of\\nOutputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Equilibrium\\nprice levelAggregate\\nsupply\\nAggregate\\ndemandFigure 19-2\\nAGGREGATE DEMAND\\nAND AGGREGATE SUPPLY .\\nEconomists use the model ofaggregate demand and aggregatesupply to analyze economicfluctuations.

Outputand the price level adjustto the point at whichthe aggregate-supplyand aggregate-demandcurves intersect.420 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nY/H11005C/H11001I/H11001G/H11001NX.\\nEach of these four components contributes to the aggregate demand for goods and\\nservices. For now, we assume that government spending is fixed by policy. Theother three components of spending—consumption, investment, and net ex-ports—depend on economic conditions and, in particular, on the price level. To un-derstand the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve, therefore, we mustexamine how the price level affects the quantity of goods and services demandedfor consumption, investment, and net exports.\\nThe Price Level and Consumption: The Wealth Effect Con-\\nsider the money that you hold in your wallet and your bank account. The nominalvalue of this money is fixed, but its real value is not. When prices fall, these dollarsare more valuable because then they can be used to buy more goods and services.Thus, a decrease in the price level makes consumers feel more wealthy, which in turn en-\\ncourages them to spend more. The increase in consumer spending means a larger quantityof goods and services demanded.\\nThe Price Level and Investment: The Interest-Rate Effect\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 16, the price level is one determinant of the quantityof money demanded. The lower the price level, the less money households need tohold to buy the goods and services they want. When the price level falls, therefore,households try to reduce their holdings of money by lending some of it out. For in-stance, a household might use its excess money to buy interest-bearing bonds. Orit might deposit its excess money in an interest-bearing savings account, and thebank would use these funds to make more loans. In either case, as households tryto convert some of their money into interest-bearing assets, they drive downQuantity of\\nOutputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Aggregate\\ndemandP1\\nY1 Y2P2\\n1. A decreasein the pricelevel . . .\\n2. . . . increases the quantity ofgoods and services demanded.Figure 19-3\\nTHEAGGREGATE -DEMAND\\nCURVE . A fall in the price level\\nfrom P1to P2increases the\\nquantity of goods and servicesdemanded from Y\\n1to Y2. There\\nare three reasons for this negativerelationship. As the price levelfalls, real wealth rises, interestrates fall, and the exchange ratedepreciates. These effectsstimulate spending onconsumption, investment, andnet exports. Increased spendingon these components of outputmeans a larger quantity of goodsand services demanded.CHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 421\\ninterest rates. Lower interest rates, in turn, encourage borrowing by firms that\\nwant to invest in new plants and equipment and by households who want to in-vest in new housing. Thus, a lower price level reduces the interest rate, encourages\\ngreater spending on investment goods, and thereby increases the quantity of goods andservices demanded.\\nThe Price Level and Net Exports: The Exchange-Rate Ef-\\nfect As we have just discussed, a lower price level in the United States lowers\\nthe U.S. interest rate. In response, some U.S. investors will seek higher returns byinvesting abroad. For instance, as the interest rate on U.S. government bonds falls,a mutual fund might sell U.S. government bonds in order to buy German govern-ment bonds. As the mutual fund tries to move assets overseas, it increases the sup-ply of dollars in the market for foreign-currency exchange. The increased supplyof dollars causes the dollar to depreciate relative to other currencies. Because eachdollar buys fewer units of foreign currencies, foreign goods become more expen-sive relative to domestic goods. This change in the real exchange rate (the relativeprice of domestic and foreign goods) increases U.S. exports of goods and servicesand decreases U.S. imports of goods and services. Net exports, which equal ex-ports minus imports, also increase. Thus, when a fall in the U.S. price level causes U.S.\\ninterest rates to fall, the real exchange rate depreciates, and this depreciation stimulatesU.S. net exports and thereby increases the quantity of goods and services demanded.\\nSummary There are, therefore, three distinct but related reasons why a fall in\\nthe price level increases the quantity of goods and services demanded: (1) Con-sumers feel wealthier, which stimulates the demand for consumption goods. (2)Interest rates fall, which stimulates the demand for investment goods. (3) The ex-change rate depreciates, which stimulates the demand for net exports. For all threereasons, the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward.\\nIt is important to keep in mind that the aggregate-demand curve (like all de-\\nmand curves) is drawn holding “other things equal.” In particular, our three ex-planations of the downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve assume that themoney supply is fixed. That is, we have been considering how a change in theprice level affects the demand for goods and services, holding the amount ofmoney in the economy constant. As we will see, a change in the quantity of moneyshifts the aggregate-demand curve. At this point, just keep in mind that the aggregate-demand curve is drawn for a given quantity of money.\\nWHY THE AGGREGATE-DEMAND CURVE MIGHT SHIFT\\nThe downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve shows that a fall in the pricelevel raises the overall quantity of goods and services demanded. Many other fac-tors, however, affect the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given pricelevel. When one of these other factors changes, the aggregate-demand curve shifts.\\nLet’s consider some examples of events that shift aggregate demand. We can\\ncategorize them according to which component of spending is most directlyaffected.\\nShifts Arising from Consumption Suppose Americans suddenly be-\\ncome more concerned about saving for retirement and, as a result, reduce theircurrent consumption. Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at422 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nany price level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left. Conversely,\\nimagine that a stock market boom makes people feel wealthy and less concernedabout saving. The resulting increase in consumer spending means a greater quan-tity of goods and services demanded at any given price level, so the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.\\nThus, any event that changes how much people want to consume at a given\\nprice level shifts the aggregate-demand curve. One policy variable that has thiseffect is the level of taxation. When the government cuts taxes, it encouragespeople to spend more, so the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. Whenthe government raises taxes, people cut back on their spending, and the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left.\\nShifts Arising from Investment Any event that changes how much\\nfirms want to invest at a given price level also shifts the aggregate-demand curve.For instance, imagine that the computer industry introduces a faster line of computers, and many firms decide to invest in new computer systems. Becausethe quantity of goods and services demanded at any price level is higher, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms become pes-simistic about future business conditions, they may cut back on investment spend-ing, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\nTax policy can also influence aggregate demand through investment. As we\\nsaw in Chapter 13, an investment tax credit (a tax rebate tied to a firm’s investmentspending) increases the quantity of investment goods that firms demand at anygiven interest rate. It therefore shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right.The repeal of an investment tax credit reduces investment and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\nAnother policy variable that can influence investment and aggregate demand\\nis the money supply. As we discuss more fully in the next chapter, an increasein the money supply lowers the interest rate in the short run. This makes borrow-ing less costly, which stimulates investment spending and thereby shifts theaggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, a decrease in the money supplyraises the interest rate, discourages investment spending, and thereby shifts theaggregate-demand curve to the left. Many economists believe that throughout U.S.history changes in monetary policy have been an important source of shifts in ag-gregate demand.\\nShifts Arising from Government Purchases The most direct way\\nthat policymakers shift the aggregate-demand curve is through government pur-chases. For example, suppose Congress decides to reduce purchases of newweapons systems. Because the quantity of goods and services demanded at anyprice level is lower, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the left. Conversely, ifstate governments start building more highways, the result is a greater quantity ofgoods and services demanded at any price level, so the aggregate-demand curveshifts to the right.\\nShifts Arising from Net Exports Any event that changes net exports\\nfor a given price level also shifts aggregate demand. For instance, when Europe ex-periences a recession, it buys fewer goods from the United States. This reducesU.S. net exports and shifts the aggregate-demand curve for the U.S. economy toCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 423\\nthe left. When Europe recovers from its recession, it starts buying U.S. goods again,\\nshifting the aggregate-demand curve to the right.\\nNet exports sometimes change because of movements in the exchange rate.\\nSuppose, for instance, that international speculators bid up the value of the U.S.dollar in the market for foreign-currency exchange. This appreciation of the dollarwould make U.S. goods more expensive compared to foreign goods, which woulddepress net exports and shift the aggregate-demand curve to the left. Conversely,a depreciation of the dollar stimulates net exports and shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right.\\nSummary In the next chapter we analyze the aggregate-demand curve in\\nmore detail. There we examine more precisely how the tools of monetary and fis-cal policy can shift aggregate demand and whether policymakers should use thesetools for that purpose. At this point, however, you should have some idea aboutwhy the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward and what kinds of events andpolicies can shift this curve. Table 19-1 summarizes what we have learned so far.\\nTable 19-1\\nTHEAGGREGATE -DEMAND\\nCURVE : SUMMARYWHYDOES THE AGGREGATE -DEMAND CURVE SLOPE DOWNWARD ?\\n1. The Wealth Effect: A lower price level increases real wealth, which encourages\\nspending on consumption.\\n2. The Interest-Rate Effect: A lower price level reduces the interest rate, which\\nencourages spending on investment.\\n3. The Exchange-Rate Effect: A lower price level causes the real exchange rate to\\ndepreciate, which encourages spending on net exports.\\nWHYMIGHT THE AGGREGATE -DEMAND CURVE SHIFT?\\n1. Shifts Arising from Consumption: An event that makes consumers spend more\\nat a given price level (a tax cut, a stock market boom) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. An event that makes consumers spend less at agiven price level (a tax hike, a stock market decline) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\n2. Shifts Arising from Investment: An event that makes firms invest more at a\\ngiven price level (optimism about the future, a fall in interest rates due to anincrease in the money supply) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to theright. An event that makes firms invest less at a given price level (pessimismabout the future, a rise in interest rates due to a decrease in the moneysupply) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\n3. Shifts Arising from Government Purchases: An increase in government\\npurchases of goods and services (greater spending on defense or highwayconstruction) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. A decreasein government purchases on goods and services (a cutback in defense orhighway spending) shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\n4.

Which way would this event shift the curve?\\nTHE AGGREGATE-SUPPLY CURVE\\nThe aggregate-supply curve tells us the total quantity of goods and services thatfirms produce and sell at any given price level. Unlike the aggregate-demandcurve, which is always downward sloping, the aggregate-supply curve shows arelationship that depends crucially on the time horizon being examined. In the long\\nrun, the aggregate-supply curve is vertical, whereas in the short run, the aggregate-supplycurve is upward sloping. To understand short-run economic fluctuations, and\\nhow the short-run behavior of the economy deviates from its long-run behavior,we need to examine both the long-run aggregate-supply curve and the short-runaggregate-supply curve.\\nWHY THE AGGREGATE-SUPPLY CURVE\\nIS VERTICAL IN THE LONG RUN\\nWhat determines the quantity of goods and services supplied in the long run? We\\nimplicitly answered this question earlier in the book when we analyzed theprocess of economic growth. In the long run, an economy’s production of goods and ser-\\nvices (its real GDP) depends on its supplies of labor, capital, and natural resources and onthe available technology used to turn these factors of production into goods and services.Because the price level does not affect these long-run determinants of real GDP , thelong-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, as in Figure 19-4. In other words, inthe long run, the economy’s labor, capital, natural resources, and technology de-termine the total quantity of goods and services supplied, and this quantity sup-plied is the same regardless of what the price level happens to be.\\nThe vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve is, in essence, just an application\\nof the classical dichotomy and monetary neutrality. As we have already discussed,classical macroeconomic theory is based on the assumption that real variables donot depend on nominal variables. The long-run aggregate-supply curve is consis-tent with this idea because it implies that the quantity of output (a real variable)does not depend on the level of prices (a nominal variable). As noted earlier, mosteconomists believe that this principle works well when studying the economyover a period of many years, but not when studying year-to-year changes. Thus,the aggregate-supply curve is vertical only in the long run.\\nOne might wonder why supply curves for specific goods and services can be\\nupward sloping if the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. The reason isthat the supply of specific goods and services depends on relative prices —the prices\\nof those goods and services compared to other prices in the economy. For example,when the price of ice cream rises, suppliers of ice cream increase their production,taking labor, milk, chocolate, and other inputs away from the production of othergoods, such as frozen yogurt. By contrast, the economy’s overall production ofCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 425\\ngoods and services is limited by its labor, capital, natural resources, and tech-\\nnology. Thus, when all prices in the economy rise together, there is no change inthe overall quantity of goods and services supplied.\\nWHY THE LONG-RUN AGGREGATE-\\nSUPPLY CURVE MIGHT SHIFT\\nThe position of the long-run aggregate-supply curve shows the quantity of goods\\nand services predicted by classical macroeconomic theory. This level of productionis sometimes called potential output or full-employment output. To be more accurate,\\nwe call it the natural rate of output because it shows what the economy produces\\nwhen unemployment is at its natural, or normal, rate. The natural rate of output isthe level of production toward which the economy gravitates in the long run.\\nAny change in the economy that alters the natural rate of output shifts the\\nlong-run aggregate-supply curve. Because output in the classical model dependson labor, capital, natural resources, and technological knowledge, we can catego-rize shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve as arising from these sources.\\nShifts Arising from Labor Imagine that an economy experiences an in-\\ncrease in immigration from abroad. Because there would be a greater number ofworkers, the quantity of goods and services supplied would increase. As a result,the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right. Conversely, if manyworkers left the economy to go abroad, the long-run aggregate-supply curvewould shift to the left.\\nThe position of the long-run aggregate-supply curve also depends on the nat-\\nural rate of unemployment, so any change in the natural rate of unemploymentshifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve. For example, if Congress were to raiseQuantity of\\nOutputNatural rate\\nof outputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Long-run\\naggregate\\nsupply\\nP2\\n1.

In the long run,\\nthe quantity of output supplieddepends on the economy’squantities of labor, capital, andnatural resources and on thetechnology for turning theseinputs into output. The quantitysupplied does not depend on theoverall price level. As a result, thelong-run aggregate-supply curveis vertical at the natural rate ofoutput.426 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nthe minimum wage substantially, the natural rate of unemployment would rise,\\nand the economy would produce a smaller quantity of goods and services. As aresult, the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the left. Conversely, ifa reform of the unemployment insurance system were to encourage unemployedworkers to search harder for new jobs, the natural rate of unemployment wouldfall, and the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right.\\nShifts Arising from Capital An increase in the economy’s capital stock\\nincreases productivity and, thereby, the quantity of goods and services supplied.As a result, the long-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right. Conversely, adecrease in the economy’s capital stock decreases productivity and the quantity ofgoods and services supplied, shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve to theleft.\\nNotice that the same logic applies regardless of whether we are discussing\\nphysical capital or human capital. An increase either in the number of machines orin the number of college degrees will raise the economy’s ability to produce goodsand services. Thus, either would shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve tothe right.\\nShifts Arising from Natural Resources An economy’s production\\ndepends on its natural resources, including its land, minerals, and weather. A dis-covery of a new mineral deposit shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve to theright. A change in weather patterns that makes farming more difficult shifts thelong-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.\\nIn many countries, important natural resources are imported from abroad.\\nA change in the availability of these resources can also shift the aggregate-supplycurve. As we discuss later in this chapter, events occurring in the world oil markethave historically been an important source of shifts in aggregate supply.\\nShifts Arising from Technological Knowledge Perhaps the most\\nimportant reason that the economy today produces more than it did a generationago is that our technological knowledge has advanced. The invention of the com-puter, for instance, has allowed us to produce more goods and services from anygiven amounts of labor, capital, and natural resources. As a result, it has shifted thelong-run aggregate-supply curve to the right.\\nAlthough not literally technological, there are many other events that act like\\nchanges in technology. As Chapter 9 explains, opening up international trade haseffects similar to inventing new production processes, so it also shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. Conversely, if the government passednew regulations preventing firms from using some production methods, perhapsbecause they were too dangerous for workers, the result would be a leftward shiftin the long-run aggregate-supply curve.\\nSummary The long-run aggregate-supply curve reflects the classical model of\\nthe economy we developed in previous chapters. Any policy or event that raisedreal GDP in previous chapters can now be viewed as increasing the quantity ofgoods and services supplied and shifting the long-run aggregate-supply curve tothe right. Any policy or event that lowered real GDP in previous chapters can nowCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 427\\nbe viewed as decreasing the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifting\\nthe long-run aggregate-supply curve to the left.\\nA NEW WAY TO DEPICT\\nLONG-RUN GROWTH AND INFLATION\\nHaving introduced the economy’s aggregate-demand curve and the long-run \\naggregate-supply curve, we now have a new way to describe the economy’s long-run trends. Figure 19-5 illustrates the changes that occur in the economy fromdecade to decade. Notice that both curves are shifting. Although there are manyforces that govern the economy in the long run and can in principle cause suchshifts, the two most important in practice are technology and monetary policy.Technological progress enhances the economy’s ability to produce goods and ser-vices, and this continually shifts the long-run aggregate-supply curve to the right.At the same time, because the Fed increases the money supply over time, the aggregate-demand curve also shifts to the right. As the figure illustrates, the resultis trend growth in output (as shown by increasing Y) and continuing inflation (as\\nshown by increasing P). This is just another way of representing the classical\\nanalysis of growth and inflation we conducted in Chapters 12 and 16.\\nThe purpose of developing the model of aggregate demand and aggregate\\nsupply, however, is not to dress our long-run conclusions in new clothing.

As the\\neconomy becomes better able toproduce goods and services overtime, primarily because oftechnological progress, the long-run aggregate-supply curve shiftsto the right. At the same time, asthe Fed increases the moneysupply, the aggregate-demandcurve also shifts to the right. Inthis figure, output grows fromY\\n1980to Y1990and then to Y2000, and\\nthe price level rises from P1980to\\nP1990and then to P2000. Thus, the\\nmodel of aggregate demand andaggregate supply offers a newway to describe the classicalanalysis of growth and inflation.428 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nit is to provide a framework for short-run analysis, as we will see in a moment. As\\nwe develop the short-run model, we keep the analysis simple by not showing thecontinuing growth and inflation depicted in Figure 19-5. But always rememberthat long-run trends provide the background for short-run fluctuations. Short-run\\nfluctuations in output and the price level should be viewed as deviations from the continu-ing long-run trends.\\nWHY THE AGGREGATE-SUPPLY CURVE\\nSLOPES UPWARD IN THE SHORT RUN\\nWe now come to the key difference between the economy in the short run and\\nin the long run: the behavior of aggregate supply. As we have already discussed,the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. By contrast, in the short run, theaggregate-supply curve is upward sloping, as shown in Figure 19-6. That is, overa period of a year or two, an increase in the overall level of prices in the economytends to raise the quantity of goods and services supplied, and a decrease in thelevel of prices tends to reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied.\\nWhat causes this positive relationship between the price level and output?\\nMacroeconomists have proposed three theories for the upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. In each theory, a specific market imperfection causesthe supply side of the economy to behave differently in the short run than it doesin the long run. Although each of the following theories will differ in detail, theyshare a common theme: The quantity of output supplied deviates from its long-run, or “natural,” level when the price level deviates from the price level thatpeople expected. When the price level rises above the expected level, output risesabove its natural rate, and when the price level falls below the expected level, out-put falls below its natural rate.\\nQuantity of\\nOutputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Short-run\\naggregate\\nsupply\\nY2 Y11.

In the short run,\\na fall in the price level from P1to\\nP2reduces the quantity of output\\nsupplied from Y1to Y2. This\\npositive relationship could bedue to misperceptions, stickywages, or sticky prices. Overtime, perceptions, wages, andprices adjust, so this positiverelationship is only temporary.CHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 429\\nThe Misperceptions Theory One approach to the short-run aggregate-\\nsupply curve is the misperceptions theory. According to this theory, changes in theoverall price level can temporarily mislead suppliers about what is happening inthe individual markets in which they sell their output. As a result of these short-run misperceptions, suppliers respond to changes in the level of prices, and thisresponse leads to an upward-sloping aggregate-supply curve.\\nTo see how this might work, suppose the overall price level falls below the\\nlevel that people expected. When suppliers see the prices of their products fall,they may mistakenly believe that their relative prices have fallen. For example,\\nwheat farmers may notice a fall in the price of wheat before they notice a fall in theprices of the many items they buy as consumers. They may infer from this obser-vation that the reward to producing wheat is temporarily low, and they may re-spond by reducing the quantity of wheat they supply. Similarly, workers maynotice a fall in their nominal wages before they notice a fall in the prices of thegoods they buy. They may infer that the reward to working is temporarily low andrespond by reducing the quantity of labor they supply. In both cases, a lower price\\nlevel causes misperceptions about relative prices, and these misperceptions induce sup-pliers to respond to the lower price level by decreasing the quantity of goods and servicessupplied.\\nThe Sticky-Wage Theory A second explanation of the upward slope of\\nthe short-run aggregate-supply curve is the sticky-wage theory. According to thistheory, the short-run aggregate-supply curve slopes upward because nominalwages are slow to adjust, or are “sticky,” in the short run. To some extent, the slowadjustment of nominal wages is attributable to long-term contracts between work-ers and firms that fix nominal wages, sometimes for as long as three years. In ad-dition, this slow adjustment may be attributable to social norms and notions offairness that influence wage setting and that change only slowly over time.\\nTo see what sticky nominal wages mean for aggregate supply, imagine that a\\nfirm has agreed in advance to pay its workers a certain nominal wage based onwhat it expected the price level to be. If the price level Pfalls below the level that\\nwas expected and the nominal wage remains stuck at W,then the real wage W/P\\nrises above the level the firm planned to pay. Because wages are a large part of afirm’s production costs, a higher real wage means that the firm’s real costs haverisen. The firm responds to these higher costs by hiring less labor and producinga smaller quantity of goods and services. In other words, because wages do not ad-\\njust immediately to the price level, a lower price level makes employment and produc-tion less profitable, which induces firms to reduce the quantity of goods and services supplied.\\nThe Sticky-Price Theory Recently, some economists have advocated a\\nthird approach to the short-run aggregate-supply curve, called the sticky-price the-ory. As we just discussed, the sticky-wage theory emphasizes that nominal wagesadjust slowly over time. The sticky-price theory emphasizes that the prices ofsome goods and services also adjust sluggishly in response to changing economicconditions. This slow adjustment of prices occurs in part because there are costs toadjusting prices, called menu costs. These menu costs include the cost of printingand distributing catalogs and the time required to change price tags. As a result ofthese costs, prices as well as wages may be sticky in the short run.430 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nTo see the implications of sticky prices for aggregate supply, suppose that each\\nfirm in the economy announces its prices in advance based on the economic con-ditions it expects to prevail. Then, after prices are announced, the economy expe-riences an unexpected contraction in the money supply, which (as we havelearned) will reduce the overall price level in the long run. Although some firmsreduce their prices immediately in response to changing economic conditions,other firms may not want to incur additional menu costs and, therefore, may tem-porarily lag behind. Because these lagging firms have prices that are too high, theirsales decline. Declining sales, in turn, cause these firms to cut back on productionand employment. In other words, because not all prices adjust instantly to changing\\nconditions, an unexpected fall in the price level leaves some firms with higher-than-desiredprices, and these higher-than-desired prices depress sales and induce firms to reduce thequantity of goods and services they produce.\\nSummary There are three alternative explanations for the upward slope of the\\nshort-run aggregate-supply curve: (1) misperceptions, (2) sticky wages, and (3)sticky prices. Economists debate which of these theories is correct. For our pur-poses in this book, however, the similarities of the theories are more importantthan the differences. All three theories suggest that output deviates from its nat-ural rate when the price level deviates from the price level that people expected.We can express this mathematically as follows:\\n/H11005/H11001 a\\n/H20898/H11002 /H20899\\nwhere ais a number that determines how much output responds to unexpected\\nchanges in the price level.\\nNotice that each of the three theories of short-run aggregate supply empha-\\nsizes a problem that is likely to be only temporary. Whether the upward slope ofthe aggregate-supply curve is attributable to misperceptions, sticky wages, orsticky prices, these conditions will not persist forever. Eventually, as people adjusttheir expectations, misperceptions are corrected, nominal wages adjust, and pricesbecome unstuck. In other words, the expected and actual price levels are equalin the long run, and the aggregate-supply curve is vertical rather than upwardsloping.\\nWHY THE SHORT-RUN AGGREGATE-SUPPLY\\nCURVE MIGHT SHIFT\\nThe short-run aggregate-supply curve tells us the quantity of goods and services\\nsupplied in the short run for any given level of prices. We can think of this curveas similar to the long-run aggregate-supply curve but made upward sloping by the presence of misperceptions, sticky wages, and sticky prices. Thus, when think-Expected\\nprice levelActual\\nprice levelNatural rate of\\noutputQuantity of\\noutput suppliedCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 431\\ning about what shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve, we have to consider\\nall those variables that shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve plus a newvariable—the expected price level—that influences misperceptions, sticky wages,and sticky prices.\\nLet’s start with what we know about the long-run aggregate-supply curve. As\\nwe discussed earlier, shifts in the long-run aggregate-supply curve normally arisefrom changes in labor, capital, natural resources, or technological knowledge.These same variables shift the short-run aggregate-supply curve. For example,when an increase in the economy’s capital stock increases productivity, both thelong-run and short-run aggregate-supply curves shift to the right. When an in-crease in the minimum wage raises the natural rate of unemployment, both thelong-run and short-run aggregate-supply curves shift to the left.\\nThe important new variable that affects the position of the short-run\\naggregate-supply curve is people’s expectation of the price level. As we have dis-cussed, the quantity of goods and services supplied depends, in the short run, onmisperceptions, sticky wages, and sticky prices. Yet perceptions, wages, and pricesare set on the basis of expectations of the price level. So when expectations change,the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts.\\nTo make this idea more concrete, let’s consider a specific theory of aggregate\\nsupply—the sticky-wage theory. According to this theory, when people expect theprice level to be high, they tend to set wages high. High wages raise firms’ costsand, for any given actual price level, reduce the quantity of goods and services thatfirms supply. Thus, when the expected price level rises, wages rise, costs rise, andfirms choose to supply a smaller quantity of goods and services at any given actualprice level. Thus, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the left. Con-versely, when the expected price level falls, wages fall, costs fall, firms increaseproduction, and the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts to the right.\\nA similar logic applies in each theory of aggregate supply. The general lesson\\nis the following: An increase in the expected price level reduces the quantity of goods and\\nservices supplied and shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the left. A decrease inthe expected price level raises the quantity of goods and services supplied and shifts theshort-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. As we will see in the next section, this\\ninfluence of expectations on the position of the short-run aggregate-supply curveplays a key role in reconciling the economy’s behavior in the short run with its be-havior in the long run. In the short run, expectations are fixed, and the economyfinds itself at the intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the short-runaggregate-supply curve. In the long run, expectations adjust, and the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts. This shift ensures that the economy eventuallyfinds itself at the intersection of the aggregate-demand curve and the long-runaggregate-supply curve.\\nYou should now have some understanding about why the short-run\\naggregate-supply curve slopes upward and what events and policies can causethis curve to shift. Table 19-2 summarizes our discussion.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Explain why the long-run aggregate-supply curve is\\nvertical.

But even now we can use what we have learned about aggregate demandand aggregate supply to examine the two basic causes of short-run fluctuations.\\nFigure 19-7 shows an economy in long-run equilibrium. Equilibrium output\\nand the price level are determined by the intersection of the aggregate-demandcurve and the long-run aggregate-supply curve, shown as point A in the figure. Atthis point, output is at its natural rate. The short-run aggregate-supply curvepasses through this point as well, indicating that perceptions, wages, and pricesTable 19-2\\nTHESHORT -RUN\\nAGGREGATE -SUPPLY\\nCURVE :SUMMARYWHYDOES THE SHORT -RUNAGGREGATE -SUPPLY CURVE SLOPE UPWARD ?\\n1.

Shifts Arising from Labor: An increase in the quantity of labor available\\n(perhaps due to a fall in the natural rate of unemployment) shifts theaggregate-supply curve to the right.

A decrease in the availabletechnology (perhaps due to government regulation) shifts the aggregate-supply curve to the left.\\n5. Shifts Arising from the Expected Price Level: A decrease in the expected price\\nlevel shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right. An increasein the expected price level shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curveto the left.CHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 433\\nhave fully adjusted to this long-run equilibrium. That is, when an economy is in its\\nlong-run equilibrium, perceptions, wages, and prices must have adjusted so thatthe intersection of aggregate demand with short-run aggregate supply is the sameas the intersection of aggregate demand with long-run aggregate supply.\\nTHE EFFECTS OF A SHIFT IN AGGREGATE DEMAND\\nSuppose that for some reason a wave of pessimism suddenly overtakes the econ-omy. The cause might be a scandal in the White House, a crash in the stock market,or the outbreak of a war overseas. Because of this event, many people lose confi-dence in the future and alter their plans. Households cut back on their spendingand delay major purchases, and firms put off buying new equipment.\\nWhat is the impact of such a wave of pessimism on the economy? Such an\\nevent reduces the aggregate demand for goods and services. That is, for any givenprice level, households and firms now want to buy a smaller quantity of goodsand services. As Figure 19-8 shows, the aggregate-demand curve shifts to the leftfrom AD\\n1to AD2.\\nIn this figure we can examine the effects of the fall in aggregate demand. In the\\nshort run, the economy moves along the initial short-run aggregate-supply curveAS\\n1, going from point A to point B. As the economy moves from point A to point B,\\noutput falls from Y1to Y2, and the price level falls from P1to P2. The falling level of\\noutput indicates that the economy is in a recession. Although not shown in the figure, firms respond to lower sales and production by reducing employment.Thus, the pessimism that caused the shift in aggregate demand is, to some extent,self-fulfilling: Pessimism about the future leads to falling incomes and risingunemployment.Natural rate\\nof outputQuantity of\\nOutputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Equilibrium\\npriceShort-run\\naggregate\\nsupplyLong-run\\naggregate\\nsupply\\nAggregate\\ndemandAFigure 19-7\\nTHELONG -RUNEQUILIBRIUM .\\nThe long-run equilibrium ofthe economy is found where theaggregate-demand curve crossesthe long-run aggregate-supplycurve (point A). When theeconomy reaches this long-runequilibrium, perceptions, wages,and prices will have adjusted sothat the short-run aggregate-supply curve crosses thispoint as well.434 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nWhat should policymakers do when faced with such a recession? One possi-\\nbility is to take action to increase aggregate demand. As we noted earlier, an in-crease in government spending or an increase in the money supply would increasethe quantity of goods and services demanded at any price and, therefore, wouldshift the aggregate-demand curve to the right. If policymakers can act with suffi-cient speed and precision, they can offset the initial shift in aggregate demand, re-turn the aggregate-demand curve back to AD\\n1, and bring the economy back to\\npoint A. (The next chapter discusses in more detail the ways in which monetaryand fiscal policy influence aggregate demand, as well as some of the practical dif-ficulties in using these policy instruments.)\\nEven without action by policymakers, the recession will remedy itself over a\\nperiod of time. Because of the reduction in aggregate demand, the price level falls.Eventually, expectations catch up with this new reality, and the expected pricelevel falls as well. Because the fall in the expected price level alters perceptions,wages, and prices, it shifts the short-run aggregate-supply curve to the right fromAS\\n1to AS2in Figure 19-8. This adjustment of expectations allows the economy\\nover time to approach point C, where the new aggregate demand-curve ( AD2)\\ncrosses the long-run aggregate-supply curve.\\nIn the new long-run equilibrium, point C, output is back to its natural rate.\\nEven though the wave of pessimism has reduced aggregate demand, the pricelevel has fallen sufficiently (to P\\n3) to offset the shift in the aggregate-demand\\ncurve. Thus, in the long run, the shift in aggregate demand is reflected fully in theprice level and not at all in the level of output. In other words, the long-run effectof a shift in aggregate demand is a nominal change (the price level is lower) butnot a real change (output is the same).Quantity of\\nOutputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Short-run aggregate\\nsupply, AS1Long-run\\naggregate\\nsupply\\nAggregate\\ndemand, AD1A\\nB\\nCP1\\nP2\\nP3\\nY1 Y2AD2AS2\\n1.

Let’s now take a longer look at U.S.economic history. Figure 19-9 shows data on real GDP going back to 1900. Mostshort-run economic fluctuations are hard to see in this figure; they are dwarfedby the 25-fold rise in GDP over the past century. Yet two episodes jump out asbeing particularly significant—the large drop in real GDP in the early 1930s andthe large increase in real GDP in the early 1940s. Both of these events are attrib-utable to shifts in aggregate demand.\\nThe economic calamity of the early 1930s is called the Great Depression, and\\nit is by far the largest economic downturn in U.S. history. Real GDP fell by 27 percent from 1929 to 1933, and unemployment rose from 3 percent to 25 To sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate demand has two important\\nlessons:\\nNIn the short run, shifts in aggregate demand cause fluctuations in the\\neconomy’s output of goods and services.\\nNIn the long run, shifts in aggregate demand affect the overall price level but\\ndo not affect output.\\nReal GDP\\n(billions of\\n1992 dollars)\\n1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1990 1960 2000 1970 19808,000\\n4,0002,0001,000\\n500250The Great \\nDepression The World War II\\nBoomReal GDPFigure 19-9\\nU.S. R EAL GDP SINCE 1900.\\nOver the course of U.S. economichistory, two fluctuations standout as being especially large.During the early 1930s, theeconomy went through the GreatDepression, when the productionof goods and servicesplummeted. During the early1940s, the United States enteredWorld War II, and the economyexperienced rapidly risingproduction. Both of these eventsare usually explained by largeshifts in aggregate demand.\\nNOTE: Real GDP is graphed here using a proportional scale. This means that equal distances on the vertical axis\\nrepresent equal percentage changes.

At the same time, the price level fell by 22 percent over these four years.\\nMany other countries experienced similar declines in output and prices duringthis period.\\nEconomic historians continue to debate the causes of the Great Depression,\\nbut most explanations center on a large decline in aggregate demand. Whatcaused aggregate demand to contract? Here is where the disagreement arises.\\nMany economists place primary blame on the decline in the money supply:\\nFrom 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell by 28 percent. As you may recall fromour discussion of the monetary system in Chapter 15, this decline in the moneysupply was due to problems in the banking system. As households withdrewtheir money from financially shaky banks and bankers became more cau-tious and started holding greater reserves, the process of money creation underfractional-reserve banking went into reverse. The Fed, meanwhile, failed to off-set this fall in the money multiplier with expansionary open-market operations.As a result, the money supply declined. Many economists blame the Fed’s fail-ure to act for the Great Depression’s severity.\\nOther economists have suggested alternative reasons for the collapse in\\naggregate demand. For example, stock prices fell about 90 percent during thisperiod, depressing household wealth and thereby consumer spending. In addi-tion, the banking problems may have prevented some firms from obtaining thefinancing they wanted for investment projects, and this would have depressedinvestment spending. Of course, all of these forces may have acted together tocontract aggregate demand during the Great Depression.\\nThe second significant episode in Figure 19-9—the economic boom of the\\nearly 1940s—is easier to explain. The obvious cause of this event is World WarII. As the United States entered the war overseas, the federal government had todevote more resources to the military. Government purchases of goods andservices increased almost fivefold from 1939 to 1944. This huge expansion inaggregate demand almost doubled the economy’s production of goods andservices and led to a 20 percent increase in the price level (although widespreadgovernment price controls limited the rise in prices). Unemployment fell from17 percent in 1939 to about 1 percent in 1944—the lowest level in U.S. history.\\nWARS: ONE WAY TO STIMULATE AGGREGATE DEMANDCHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 437\\nTHE EFFECTS OF A SHIFT IN AGGREGATE SUPPLY\\nImagine once again an economy in its long-run equilibrium.

Or a war in the Middle East might interrupt the ship-\\nping of crude oil, driving up the cost of producing oil products.\\nWhat is the macroeconomic impact of such an increase in production costs?\\nFor any given price level, firms now want to supply a smaller quantity of goodsand services. Thus, as Figure 19-10 shows, the short-run aggregate-supply curveshifts to the left from AS\\n1to AS2. (Depending on the event, the long-run aggregate-\\nsupply curve might also shift. To keep things simple, however, we will assumethat it does not.)\\nIn this figure we can trace the effects of the leftward shift in aggregate supply.\\nIn the short run, the economy moves along the existing aggregate-demand curve,going from point A to point B.

Eventually, however, the recession will remedy itself as perceptions,wages, and prices adjust to the higher production costs. A period of low outputand high unemployment, for instance, puts downward pressure on workers’wages. Lower wages, in turn, increase the quantity of output supplied. Over time,as the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts back toward AS\\n1, the price level\\nfalls, and the quantity of output approaches its natural rate.

Crude oil is a key input into theproduction of many goods and services, and much of the world’s oil comesfrom Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Middle Eastern countries. When someevent (usually political in origin) reduces the supply of crude oil flowing fromthis region, the price of oil rises around the world. U.S. firms that produce gaso-line, tires, and many other products experience rising costs. The result is a left-ward shift in the aggregate-supply curve, which in turn leads to stagflation.curve by shifting the aggregate-demand curve. This possibility is shown in Fig-ure 19-11. In this case, changes in policy shift the aggregate-demand curve to theright from AD\\n1to AD2—exactly enough to prevent the shift in aggregate supply\\nfrom affecting output. The economy moves directly from point A to point C. Out-put remains at its natural rate, and the price level rises from P\\n1to P3. In this case,\\npolicymakers are said to accommodate the shift in aggregate supply because they\\nallow the increase in costs to affect the level of prices permanently.\\nTo sum up, this story about shifts in aggregate supply has two important\\nimplications:\\nNShifts in aggregate supply can cause stagflation—a combination of recession\\n(falling output) and inflation (rising prices).\\nNPolicymakers who can influence aggregate demand cannot offset both of\\nthese adverse effects simultaneously.Quantity of\\nOutputNatural rate\\nof outputPrice\\nLevel\\n0Short-run\\naggregate\\nsupply, AS1Long-run\\naggregate\\nsupply\\nAggregate demand, AD1AC\\nP2P3\\nP1AS2\\n3. . . . which\\ncauses theprice level to rise further . . .\\n4. . . . but keeps outputat its natural rate.2. . . . policymakers canaccommodate the shiftby expanding aggregatedemand . . .1.

The countries with\\nlarge oil reserves got together as members of OPEC, the Organization of Petro-leum Exporting Countries. OPEC was a cartel —a group of sellers that attempts\\nto thwart competition and reduce production in order to raise prices. And, in-deed, oil prices rose substantially. From 1973 to 1975, oil approximately doubledin price. Oil-importing countries around the world experienced simultaneousinflation and recession. The U.S. inflation rate as measured by the CPI exceeded10 percent for the first time in decades. Unemployment rose from 4.9 percent in1973 to 8.5 percent in 1975.\\nAlmost the same thing happened again a few years later. In the late 1970s,\\nthe OPEC countries again restricted the supply of oil to raise the price. From1978 to 1981, the price of oil more than doubled. Once again, the result wasstagflation. Inflation, which had subsided somewhat after the first OPEC event,again rose above 10 percent per year. But because the Fed was not willing to ac-commodate such a large rise in inflation, a recession was soon to follow. Unem-ployment rose from about 6 percent in 1978 and 1979 to about 10 percent a fewyears later.\\nThe world market for oil can also be a source of favorable shifts in aggre-\\ngate supply. In 1986 squabbling broke out among members of OPEC. Membercountries reneged on their agreements to restrict oil production. In the worldmarket for crude oil, prices fell by about half. This fall in oil prices reduced coststo U.S. firms, which shifted the aggregate-supply curve to the right. As a result,the U.S. economy experienced the opposite of stagflation: Output grew rapidly,unemployment fell, and the inflation rate reached its lowest level in manyyears.\\nIn recent years, the world market for oil has been relatively quiet. The only\\nexception has been a brief period during 1990, just before the Persian Gulf War,when oil prices temporarily spiked up out of fear that a long military conflictmight disrupt oil production. Yet this recent tranquillity does not mean that theUnited States no longer needs to worry about oil prices. Political troubles inthe Middle East (or greater cooperation among the members of OPEC) couldalways send oil prices higher. The macroeconomic result of a large rise in oilprices could easily resemble the stagflation of the 1970s.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Suppose that the election of a popular presidential candidate\\nsuddenly increases people’s confidence in the future. Use the model ofaggregate demand and aggregate supply to analyze the effect on the economy.\\nCONCLUSION: THE ORIGINS OF AGGREGATE\\nDEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY\\nThis chapter has achieved two goals. First, we have discussed some of the impor-\\ntant facts about short-run fluctuations in economic activity. Second, we have in-troduced a basic model to explain those fluctuations, called the model of aggregatedemand and aggregate supply. In the next two chapters we look at each piece of\\nCHANGES IN MIDDLE EASTERN OIL\\nPRODUCTION ARE ONE SOURCE OF\\nU.S. ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS .CHAPTER 19 AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 441\\nthis model in more detail in order to understand more fully what causes fluctua-\\ntions in the economy and how policymakers might respond to these fluctuations.\\nNow that we have a preliminary understanding of this model, it is worthwhile\\nto step back from it and consider its history. How did this model of short-run fluc-tuations develop? The answer is that this model, to a large extent, is a by-productof the Great Depression of the 1930s. Economists and policymakers at the timewere puzzled about what had caused this calamity and were uncertain about howto deal with it.\\nIn 1936, economist John Maynard Keynes published a book titled The General\\nTheory of Employment, Interest, and Money, which attempted to explain short-run\\neconomic fluctuations in general and the Great Depression in particular. Keynes’sprimary message was that recessions and depressions can occur because of inade-quate aggregate demand for goods and services. Keynes had long been a critic ofclassical economic theory—the theory we examined in Chapters 12 through 18—because it could explain only the long-run effects of policies. A few years before of-fering The General Theory, Keynes had written the following about classical\\neconomics:\\nThe long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all\\ndead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuousseasons they can only tell us when the storm is long past, the ocean will be flat.\\nKeynes’s message was aimed at policymakers as well as economists. As the\\nworld’s economies suffered with high unemployment, Keynes advocated policiesto increase aggregate demand, including government spending on public works.In the next chapter we examine in detail how policymakers can try to use the toolsof monetary and fiscal policy to influence aggregate demand. The analysis in thenext chapter, as well as in this one, owes much to the legacy of John MaynardKeynes.\\nN All societies experience short-run economic fluctuations\\naround long-run trends. These fluctuations are irregularand largely unpredictable. When recessions do occur,real GDP and other measures of income, spending, andproduction fall, and unemployment rises.\\nN Economists analyze short-run economic fluctuations\\nusing the model of aggregate demand and aggregatesupply. According to this model, the output of goodsand services and the overall level of prices adjust tobalance aggregate demand and aggregate supply.\\nN The aggregate-demand curve slopes downward for\\nthree reasons. First, a lower price level raises the realvalue of households’ money holdings, which stimulatesconsumer spending. Second, a lower price level reducesthe quantity of money households demand; ashouseholds try to convert money into interest-bearingassets, interest rates fall, which stimulates investment\\nspending. Third, as a lower price level reduces interestrates, the dollar depreciates in the market for foreign-currency exchange, which stimulates net exports.\\nN Any event or policy that raises consumption,\\ninvestment, government purchases, or net exports at agiven price level increases aggregate demand. Anyevent or policy that reduces consumption, investment,government purchases, or net exports at a given pricelevel decreases aggregate demand.\\nN The long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical. In the\\nlong run, the quantity of goods and services supplieddepends on the economy’s labor, capital, naturalresources, and technology, but not on the overalllevel of prices.Summary442 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nN Three theories have been proposed to explain the\\nupward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve.According to the misperceptions theory, an unexpectedfall in the price level leads suppliers to mistakenlybelieve that their relative prices have fallen, whichinduces them to reduce production. According to thesticky-wage theory, an unexpected fall in the price leveltemporarily raises real wages, which induces firms toreduce employment and production. According to thesticky-price theory, an unexpected fall in the price levelleaves some firms with prices that are temporarily toohigh, which reduces their sales and causes them to cutback production. All three theories imply that outputdeviates from its natural rate when the price leveldeviates from the price level that people expected.\\nN Events that alter the economy’s ability to produce\\noutput, such as changes in labor, capital, naturalresources, or technology, shift the short-run aggregate-supply curve (and may shift the long-run aggregate-supply curve as well). In addition, the position of\\nthe short-run aggregate-supply curve depends on theexpected price level.\\nN One possible cause of economic fluctuations is a shift in\\naggregate demand. When the aggregate-demand curveshifts to the left, for instance, output and prices fall inthe short run. Over time, as a change in the expectedprice level causes perceptions, wages, and prices toadjust, the short-run aggregate-supply curve shifts tothe right, and the economy returns to its natural rate ofoutput at a new, lower price level.\\nN A second possible cause of economic fluctuations is a\\nshift in aggregate supply. When the aggregate-supplycurve shifts to the left, the short-run effect is fallingoutput and rising prices—a combination calledstagflation. Over time, as perceptions, wages, andprices adjust, the price level falls back to its originallevel, and output recovers.\\nrecession, p. 414\\ndepression, p. 414model of aggregate demand and\\naggregate supply, p. 418aggregate-demand curve, p. 418\\naggregate-supply curve, p. 418stagflation, p. 438Key Concepts\\n1.

You observe that the president and Congress have agreed to cutgovernment spending. How should the Fed respond to this change in fiscal pol-icy? Should it expand the money supply, contract the money supply, or leave themoney supply the same?\\nTo answer this question, you need to consider the impact of monetary and fis-\\ncal policy on the economy. In the preceding chapter we saw how to explain short-run economic fluctuations using the model of aggregate demand and aggregatesupply. When the aggregate-demand curve or the aggregate-supply curve shifts,the result is fluctuations in the economy’s overall output of goods and services andin its overall level of prices. As we noted in the previous chapter, monetary andTHE INFLUENCE OF\\nMONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY\\nON AGGREGATE DEMAND\\n445446 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nfiscal policy can each influence aggregate demand. Thus, a change in one of these\\npolicies can lead to short-run fluctuations in output and prices. Policymakers willwant to anticipate this effect and, perhaps, adjust the other policy in response.\\nIn this chapter we examine in more detail how the government’s tools of mon-\\netary and fiscal policy influence the position of the aggregate-demand curve. Wehave previously discussed the long-run effects of these policies. In Chapters 12 and13 we saw how fiscal policy affects saving, investment, and long-run economicgrowth. In Chapters 15 and 16 we saw how the Fed controls the money supply andhow the money supply affects the price level in the long run. We now see howthese policy tools can shift the aggregate-demand curve and, in doing so, affectshort-run economic fluctuations.\\nAs we have already learned, many factors influence aggregate demand be-\\nsides monetary and fiscal policy. In particular, desired spending by householdsand firms determines the overall demand for goods and services. When desiredspending changes, aggregate demand shifts. If policymakers do not respond, suchshifts in aggregate demand cause short-run fluctuations in output and employ-ment. As a result, monetary and fiscal policymakers sometimes use the policylevers at their disposal to try to offset these shifts in aggregate demand andthereby stabilize the economy. Here we discuss the theory behind these policy ac-tions and some of the difficulties that arise in using this theory in practice.\\nHOW MONETARY POLICY\\nINFLUENCES AGGREGATE DEMAND\\nThe aggregate-demand curve shows the total quantity of goods and services de-\\nmanded in the economy for any price level. As you may recall from the precedingchapter, the aggregate-demand curve slopes downward for three reasons:\\nNThe wealth effect: A lower price level raises the real value of households’\\nmoney holdings, and higher real wealth stimulates consumer spending.\\nNThe interest-rate effect: A lower price level lowers the interest rate as people try\\nto lend out their excess money holdings, and the lower interest ratestimulates investment spending.\\nNThe exchange-rate effect: When a lower price level lowers the interest rate,\\ninvestors move some of their funds overseas and cause the domesticcurrency to depreciate relative to foreign currencies. This depreciation makesdomestic goods cheaper compared to foreign goods and, therefore,stimulates spending on net exports.\\nThese three effects should not be viewed as alternative theories. Instead, they oc-\\ncur simultaneously to increase the quantity of goods and services demanded whenthe price level falls and to decrease it when the price level rises.\\nAlthough all three effects work together in explaining the downward slope of\\nthe aggregate-demand curve, they are not of equal importance. Because moneyCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 447\\nholdings are a small part of household wealth, the wealth effect is the least impor-\\ntant of the three. In addition, because exports and imports represent only a smallfraction of U.S. GDP , the exchange-rate effect is not very large for the U.S. econ-omy. (This effect is much more important for smaller countries because smallercountries typically export and import a higher fraction of their GDP .) For the U.S.\\neconomy, the most important reason for the downward slope of the aggregate-demandcurve is the interest-rate effect.\\nTo understand how policy influences aggregate demand, therefore, we exam-\\nine the interest-rate effect in more detail. Here we develop a theory of how the in-terest rate is determined, called the theory of liquidity preference. After we\\ndevelop this theory, we use it to understand the downward slope of the aggregate-demand curve and how monetary policy shifts this curve. By shedding new lighton the aggregate-demand curve, the theory of liquidity preference expands ourunderstanding of short-run economic fluctuations.\\nTHE THEORY OF LIQUIDITY PREFERENCE\\nIn his classic book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John\\nMaynard Keynes proposed the theory of liquidity preference to explain what fac-tors determine the economy’s interest rate. The theory is, in essence, just an appli-cation of supply and demand. According to Keynes, the interest rate adjusts tobalance the supply and demand for money.\\nYou may recall from Chapter 11 that economists distinguish between two in-\\nterest rates: The nominal interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported, and the\\nreal interest rate is the interest rate corrected for the effects of inflation. Which in-\\nterest rate are we now trying to explain? The answer is both. In the analysis thatfollows, we hold constant the expected rate of inflation. (This assumption is rea-sonable for studying the economy in the short run, as we are now doing). Thus,when the nominal interest rate rises or falls, the real interest rate that people ex-pect to earn rises or falls as well. For the rest of this chapter, when we refer tochanges in the interest rate, you should envision the real and nominal interestrates moving in the same direction.\\nLet’s now develop the theory of liquidity preference by considering the sup-\\nply and demand for money and how each depends on the interest rate.\\nMoney Supply The first piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the sup-\\nply of money. As we first discussed in Chapter 15, the money supply in the U.S.economy is controlled by the Federal Reserve. The Fed alters the money supplyprimarily by changing the quantity of reserves in the banking system through thepurchase and sale of government bonds in open-market operations. When the Fedbuys government bonds, the dollars it pays for the bonds are typically depositedin banks, and these dollars are added to bank reserves. When the Fed sells gov-ernment bonds, the dollars it receives for the bonds are withdrawn from the bank-ing system, and bank reserves fall. These changes in bank reserves, in turn, lead tochanges in banks’ ability to make loans and create money. In addition to theseopen-market operations, the Fed can alter the money supply by changing reserverequirements (the amount of reserves banks must hold against deposits) or thediscount rate (the interest rate at which banks can borrow reserves from the Fed).theory of liquidity\\npreferenceKeynes’s theory that the interest rateadjusts to bring money supply andmoney demand into balance448 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nThese details of monetary control are important for the implementation of Fed\\npolicy, but they are not crucial in this chapter. Our goal here is to examine howchanges in the money supply affect the aggregate demand for goods and services.For this purpose, we can ignore the details of how Fed policy is implemented andsimply assume that the Fed controls the money supply directly. In other words, thequantity of money supplied in the economy is fixed at whatever level the Feddecides to set it.\\nBecause the quantity of money supplied is fixed by Fed policy, it does not de-\\npend on other economic variables. In particular, it does not depend on the interestrate. Once the Fed has made its policy decision, the quantity of money supplied isthe same, regardless of the prevailing interest rate. We represent a fixed moneysupply with a vertical supply curve, as in Figure 20-1.\\nMoney Demand The second piece of the theory of liquidity preference is the\\ndemand for money. As a starting point for understanding money demand, recallthat any asset’s liquidity refers to the ease with which that asset is converted into\\nthe economy’s medium of exchange. Money is the economy’s medium of ex-change, so it is by definition the most liquid asset available. The liquidity of moneyexplains the demand for it: People choose to hold money instead of other assetsthat offer higher rates of return because money can be used to buy goods and ser-vices.\\nAlthough many factors determine the quantity of money demanded, the one\\nemphasized by the theory of liquidity preference is the interest rate. The reason isthat the interest rate is the opportunity cost of holding money. That is, when youhold wealth as cash in your wallet, instead of as an interest-bearing bond, you losethe interest you could have earned. An increase in the interest rate raises the costof holding money and, as a result, reduces the quantity of money demanded. A de-crease in the interest rate reduces the cost of holding money and raises the quan-tity demanded. Thus, as shown in Figure 20-1, the money-demand curve slopesdownward.Quantity of\\nMoneyInterest\\nRate\\nEquilibrium\\ninterest\\nrate\\n0Money\\ndemand\\nQuantity fixed\\nby the FedMoney\\nsupply\\nr1\\nr2\\nMd\\n1 Md\\n2Figure 20-1\\nEQUILIBRIUM IN THE\\nMONEY MARKET . According to\\nthe theory of liquidity preference,the interest rate adjusts to bringthe quantity of money suppliedand the quantity of moneydemanded into balance. If theinterest rate is above theequilibrium level (such as at r\\n1),\\nthe quantity of money peoplewant to hold ( M\\nd\\n1) is less than the\\nquantity the Fed has created, andthis surplus of money putsdownward pressure on theinterest rate.

Thus, the forces of supplyand demand in the market formoney push the interest ratetoward the equilibrium interestrate, at which people are contentholding the quantity ofmoney the Fed has created.CHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 449\\nEquilibrium in the Money Market According to the theory of \\nliquidity preference, the interest rate adjusts to balance the supply and demandfor money. There is one interest rate, called the equilibrium interest rate, at which\\nthe quantity of money demanded exactly balances the quantity of money sup-plied. If the interest rate is at any other level, people will try to adjust their portfo-lios of assets and, as a result, drive the interest rate toward the equilibrium.\\nFor example, suppose that the interest rate is above the equilibrium level,\\nsuch as r\\n1in Figure 20-1. In this case, the quantity of money that people want\\nto hold, Md\\n1, is less than the quantity of money that the Fed has supplied. Those\\npeople who are holding the surplus of money will try to get rid of it by buy-ing interest-bearing bonds or by depositing it in an interest-bearing bank ac-count. Because bond issuers and banks prefer to pay lower interest rates, theyrespond to this surplus of money by lowering the interest rates they offer. As theinterest rate falls, people become more willing to hold money until, at the equilib-rium interest rate, people are happy to hold exactly the amount of money the Fedhas supplied.\\nConversely, at interest rates below the equilibrium level, such as r\\n2in Fig-\\nure 20-1, the quantity of money that people want to hold, Md\\n2, is greater than the\\nquantity of money that the Fed has supplied. As a result, people try to increasetheir holdings of money by reducing their holdings of bonds and other interest-bearing assets. As people cut back on their holdings of bonds, bond issuers findthat they have to offer higher interest rates to attract buyers. Thus, the interest raterises and approaches the equilibrium level.\\nTHE DOWNWARD SLOPE OF\\nTHE AGGREGATE-DEMAND CURVE\\nHaving seen how the theory of liquidity preference explains the economy’s equi-\\nlibrium interest rate, we now consider its implications for the aggregate demandfor goods and services. As a warm-up exercise, let’s begin by using the theory toreexamine a topic we already understand—the interest-rate effect and the down-ward slope of the aggregate-demand curve. In particular, suppose that the overalllevel of prices in the economy rises. What happens to the interest rate that balancesthe supply and demand for money, and how does that change affect the quantityof goods and services demanded?\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 16, the price level is one determinant of the quan-\\ntity of money demanded. At higher prices, more money is exchanged every time agood or service is sold. As a result, people will choose to hold a larger quantity ofmoney. That is, a higher price level increases the quantity of money demandedfor any given interest rate. Thus, an increase in the price level from P\\n1to P2shifts\\nthe money-demand curve to the right from MD1to MD2, as shown in panel (a) of\\nFigure 20-2.\\nNotice how this shift in money demand affects the equilibrium in the money\\nmarket. For a fixed money supply, the interest rate must rise to balance moneysupply and money demand. The higher price level has increased the amount ofmoney people want to hold and has shifted the money demand curve to the right.Yet the quantity of money supplied is unchanged, so the interest rate must risefrom r\\n1to r2to discourage the additional demand.450 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nThis increase in the interest rate has ramifications not only for the money mar-\\nket but also for the quantity of goods and services demanded, as shown in panel(b). At a higher interest rate, the cost of borrowing and the return to saving aregreater. Fewer households choose to borrow to buy a new house, and those whodo buy smaller houses, so the demand for residential investment falls. Fewer firmschoose to borrow to build new factories and buy new equipment, so business in-vestment falls. Thus, when the price level rises from P\\n1to P2, increasing money de-\\nmand from MD1to MD2and raising the interest rate from r1to r2, the quantity of\\ngoods and services demanded falls from Y1to Y2.Quantity\\nof MoneyQuantity fixed\\nby the Fed0Interest\\nRate\\nr2\\nr1Money demand at price level \\nP2, MD2 \\nMoney demand at\\nprice level P1, MD1 Money\\nsupply(a) The Money Market\\n(b) The Aggregate-Demand Curve3. . . . which\\nincreases the equilibriuminterest rate . . . 2. . . . increases thedemand for money . . . \\nQuantity\\nof Output0Price\\nLevel\\nAggregate\\ndemandP2\\nY2 Y1P1\\n4. . . . which in turn reduces the quantityof goods and services demanded.1.

This increase in moneydemand causes the interest rateto rise from r\\n1to r2. Because\\nthe interest rate is the cost ofborrowing, the increase in theinterest rate reduces the quantityof goods and services demandedfrom Y\\n1to Y2. This negative\\nrelationship between the pricelevel and quantity demanded isrepresented with a downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve,as in panel (b).CHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 451\\nHence, this analysis of the interest-rate effect can be summarized in three\\nsteps: (1) A higher price level raises money demand. (2) Higher money demandleads to a higher interest rate. (3) A higher interest rate reduces the quantity ofgoods and services demanded.\\nOf course, the same logic works in reverse as well: A lower price level reduces\\nmoney demand, which leads to a lower interest rate, and this in turn increases thequantity of goods and services demanded. The end result of this analysis is a neg-ative relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods and servicesdemanded, which is illustrated with a downward-sloping aggregate-demandcurve.\\nAt this point, we should pause\\nand reflect on a seemingly awk-ward embarrassment of riches.It might appear as if we nowhave two theories for how in-terest rates are determined.Chapter 13 said that the inter-est rate adjusts to balance thesupply and demand for loan-able funds (that is, nationalsaving and desired invest-ment). By contrast, we just es-tablished here that the interest\\nrate adjusts to balance the supply and demand for money.How can we reconcile these two theories?\\nTo answer this question, we must again consider the\\ndifferences between the long-run and short-run behavior ofthe economy. Three macroeconomic variables are of centralimportance: the economy’s output of goods and services,the interest rate, and the price level. According to the clas-sical macroeconomic theory we developed in Chapters 12,13, and 16, these variables are determined as follows:\\n1.Output is determined by the supplies of capital and\\nlabor and the available production technology forturning capital and labor into output. (We call this thenatural rate of output.)\\n2. For any given level of output, the interest rate adjusts\\nto balance the supply and demand for loanable funds.\\n3. The price level adjusts to balance the supply and\\ndemand for money. Changes in the supply of moneylead to proportionate changes in the price level.\\nThese are three of the essential propositions of classical\\neconomic theory. Most economists believe that thesepropositions do a good job of describing how the economyworks in the long run.Yet these propositions do not hold in the short run. As\\nwe discussed in the preceding chapter, many prices areslow to adjust to changes in the money supply; this is re-flected in a short-run aggregate-supply curve that is upwardsloping rather than vertical. As a result, the overall pricelevel cannot, by itself, balance the supply and demand formoney in the short run. This stickiness of the price levelforces the interest rate to move in order to bring the moneymarket into equilibrium. These changes in the interest rate,in turn, affect the aggregate demand for goods and ser-vices. As aggregate demand fluctuates, the economy’s out-put of goods and services moves away from the leveldetermined by factor supplies and technology.\\nFor issues concerning the short run, then, it is best to\\nthink about the economy as follows:\\n1. The price level is stuck at some level (based on\\npreviously formed expectations) and, in the short run,is relatively unresponsive to changing economicconditions.\\n2. For any given price level, the interest rate adjusts to\\nbalance the supply and demand for money.\\n3. The level of output responds to the aggregate demand\\nfor goods and services, which is in part determined bythe interest rate that balances the money market.\\nNotice that this precisely reverses the order of analysis\\nused to study the economy in the long run.\\nThus, the different theories of the interest rate are use-\\nful for different purposes. When thinking about the long-rundeterminants of interest rates, it is best to keep in mind theloanable-funds theory. This approach highlights the impor-tance of an economy’s saving propensities and investmentopportunities. By contrast, when thinking about the short-run determinants of interest rates, it is best to keep in mindthe liquidity-preference theory. This theory highlights the im-portance of monetary policy. FYI\\nInterest Rates\\nin the Long Run\\nand the\\nShort Run\\n452 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nCHANGES IN THE MONEY SUPPLY\\nSo far we have used the theory of liquidity preference to explain more fully how\\nthe total quantity of goods and services demanded in the economy changes as theprice level changes. That is, we have examined movements along the downward-sloping aggregate-demand curve. The theory also sheds light, however, on someof the other events that alter the quantity of goods and services demanded. When-ever the quantity of goods and services demanded changes for a given price level,\\nthe aggregate-demand curve shifts.\\nOne important variable that shifts the aggregate-demand curve is monetary\\npolicy. To see how monetary policy affects the economy in the short run, supposethat the Fed increases the money supply by buying government bonds in open-market operations. (Why the Fed might do this will become clear later after we un-derstand the effects of such a move.) Let’s consider how this monetary injectioninfluences the equilibrium interest rate for a given price level. This will tell us whatthe injection does to the position of the aggregate-demand curve.\\nAs panel (a) of Figure 20-3 shows, an increase in the money supply shifts the\\nmoney-supply curve to the right from MS\\n1to MS2. Because the money-demand\\ncurve has not changed, the interest rate falls from r1to r2to balance money supply\\nand money demand. That is, the interest rate must fall to induce people to hold theadditional money the Fed has created.\\nOnce again, the interest rate influences the quantity of goods and services de-\\nmanded, as shown in panel (b) of Figure 20-3. The lower interest rate reduces thecost of borrowing and the return to saving. Households buy more and largerhouses, stimulating the demand for residential investment. Firms spend more onnew factories and new equipment, stimulating business investment. As a result,the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price level, P–, rises from\\nY\\n1to Y2. Of course, there is nothing special about P–:The monetary injection raises\\nthe quantity of goods and services demanded at every price level. Thus, the entireaggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.\\nTo sum up: When the Fed increases the money supply, it lowers the interest rate and\\nincreases the quantity of goods and services demanded for any given price level, shifting theaggregate-demand curve to the right. Conversely, when the Fed contracts the money sup-ply, it raises the interest rate and reduces the quantity of goods and services demanded forany given price level, shifting the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\nTHE ROLE OF INTEREST-RATE TARGETS IN FED POLICY\\nHow does the Federal Reserve affect the economy? Our discussion here and ear-lier in the book has treated the money supply as the Fed’s policy instrument. Whenthe Fed buys government bonds in open-market operations, it increases the moneysupply and expands aggregate demand. When the Fed sells government bonds inopen-market operations, it decreases the money supply and contracts aggregatedemand.\\nOften discussions of Fed policy treat the interest rate, rather than the money\\nsupply, as the Fed’s policy instrument. Indeed, in recent years, the Federal Reservehas conducted policy by setting a target for the federal funds rate —the interest rate\\nthat banks charge one another for short-term loans. This target is reevaluatedevery six weeks at meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). TheCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 453\\nFOMC has chosen to set a target for the federal funds rate (rather than for the\\nmoney supply, as it has done at times in the past) in part because the money sup-ply is hard to measure with sufficient precision.\\nThe Fed’s decision to target an interest rate does not fundamentally alter our\\nanalysis of monetary policy. The theory of liquidity preference illustrates an im-portant principle: Monetary policy can be described either in terms of the money sup-\\nply or in terms of the interest rate. When the FOMC sets a target for the federal funds\\nrate of, say, 6 percent, the Fed’s bond traders are told: “Conduct whatever open-market operations are necessary to ensure that the equilibrium interest rate equalsMS2 Money\\nsupply, \\nMS1\\nY1Aggregate\\ndemand, AD1\\nY2PMoney demand at price level \\nP\\nAD2Quantity\\nof Money0Interest\\nRate\\nr1\\nr2(a) The Money Market\\n(b) The Aggregate-Demand Curve\\nQuantity\\nof Output0Price\\nLevel\\n3. . . . which increases the quantity of goods and services demanded at a given price level.2. . . . theequilibriuminterest ratefalls . . . 1.

Thus,\\nin panel (b), the aggregate-demand curve shifts to theright from AD\\n1to AD2.454 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nCASE STUDY WHY THE FED WATCHES THE STOCK MARKET\\n(AND VICE VERSA)\\n“Irrational exuberance.” That was how Federal Reserve Chairman Alan\\nGreenspan once described the booming stock market of the late 1990s. He isright that the market was exuberant: Average stock prices increased about four-fold during this decade. Whether this rise was irrational, however, is more opento debate.\\nRegardless of how we view the booming market, it does raise an important\\nquestion: How should the Fed respond to stock-market fluctuations? The Fed6 percent.” In other words, when the Fed sets a target for the interest rate, it com-mits itself to adjusting the money supply in order to make the equilibrium in themoney market hit that target.\\nAs a result, changes in monetary policy can be viewed either in terms of a\\nchanging target for the interest rate or in terms of a change in the money supply.When you read in the newspaper that “the Fed has lowered the federal funds ratefrom 6 to 5 percent,” you should understand that this occurs only because theFed’s bond traders are doing what it takes to make it happen. To lower the federalfunds rate, the Fed’s bond traders buy government bonds, and this purchaseincreases the money supply and lowers the equilibrium interest rate (just as inFigure 20-3). Similarly, when the FOMC raises the target for the federal funds rate,the bond traders sell government bonds, and this sale decreases the money supplyand raises the equilibrium interest rate.\\nThe lessons from all this are quite simple: Changes in monetary policy that\\naim to expand aggregate demand can be described either as increasing the moneysupply or as lowering the interest rate. Changes in monetary policy that aim tocontract aggregate demand can be described either as decreasing the money sup-ply or as raising the interest rate.\\n“Ray Brown on bass, Elvin Jones on drums, and Alan Greenspan on interest rates.”CHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 455\\nhas no reason to care about stock prices in themselves, but it does have the job\\nof monitoring and responding to developments in the overall economy, and thestock market is a piece of that puzzle. When the stock market booms, house-holds become wealthier, and this increased wealth stimulates consumer spend-ing. In addition, a rise in stock prices makes it more attractive for firms to sellnew shares of stock, and this stimulates investment spending. For both reasons,a booming stock market expands the aggregate demand for goods and services.\\nAs we discuss more fully later in the chapter, one of the Fed’s goals is to sta-\\nbilize aggregate demand, for greater stability in aggregate demand meansgreater stability in output and the price level. To do this, the Fed might respondto a stock-market boom by keeping the money supply lower and interest rateshigher than it otherwise would. The contractionary effects of higher interestrates would offset the expansionary effects of higher stock prices. In fact, thisanalysis does describe Fed behavior: Real interest rates were kept high by his-torical standards during the “irrationally exuberant” stock-market boom of thelate 1990s.\\nThe opposite occurs when the stock market falls. Spending on consumption\\nand investment declines, depressing aggregate demand and pushing the econ-omy toward recession. To stabilize aggregate demand, the Fed needs to increasethe money supply and lower interest rates. And, indeed, that is what it typicallydoes. For example, on October 19, 1987, the stock market fell by 22.6 percent—its biggest one-day drop in history. The Fed responded to the market crash by \\nNEWSPAPERS ARE FILLED WITHSTORIES\\nabout monetary policymakers adjust-\\ning the money supply and interest ratesin response to changing economic con-ditions.

How does this change in monetary policy affect the aggregate-demand curve?\\nHOW FISCAL POLICY\\nINFLUENCES AGGREGATE DEMAND\\nThe government can influence the behavior of the economy not only with mone-\\ntary policy but also with fiscal policy. Fiscal policy refers to the government’schoices regarding the overall level of government purchases or taxes. Earlier in thebook we examined how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, and growth inthe long run. In the short run, however, the primary effect of fiscal policy is on theaggregate demand for goods and services.\\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENT PURCHASES\\nWhen policymakers change the money supply or the level of taxes, they shift theaggregate-demand curve by influencing the spending decisions of firms or house-holds. By contrast, when the government alters its own purchases of goods andservices, it shifts the aggregate-demand curve directly.\\nSuppose, for instance, that the U.S. Department of Defense places a $20 billion\\norder for new fighter planes with Boeing, the large aircraft manufacturer. This or-der raises the demand for the output produced by Boeing, which induces the com-pany to hire more workers and increase production. Because Boeing is part of theeconomy, the increase in the demand for Boeing planes means an increase in thetotal quantity of goods and services demanded at each price level. As a result, theaggregate-demand curve shifts to the right.\\nBy how much does this $20 billion order from the government shift the \\naggregate-demand curve? At first, one might guess that the aggregate-demandcurve shifts to the right by exactly $20 billion. It turns out, however, that this is notincreasing the money supply and lowering interest rates. The federal funds rate fell from 7.7 percent at the beginning of October to 6.6 percent at the end of themonth. In part because of the Fed’s quick action, the economy avoided a reces-sion.\\nWhile the Fed keeps an eye on the stock market, stock-market participants\\nalso keep an eye on the Fed. Because the Fed can influence interest rates andeconomic activity, it can alter the value of stocks. For example, when the Fedraises interest rates by reducing the money supply, it makes owning stocks lessattractive for two reasons. First, a higher interest rate means that bonds, thealternative to stocks, are earning a higher return. Second, the Fed’s tightening ofmonetary policy risks pushing the economy into a recession, which reducesprofits. As a result, stock prices often fall when the Fed raises interest rates.CHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 457\\nright. There are two macroeconomic effects that make the size of the shift in ag-\\ngregate demand differ from the change in government purchases. The first—themultiplier effect—suggests that the shift in aggregate demand could be larger than\\n$20 billion. The second—the crowding-out effect—suggests that the shift in aggre-gate demand could be smaller than $20 billion. We now discuss each of these effects\\nin turn.\\nTHE MULTIPLIER EFFECT\\nWhen the government buys $20 billion of goods from Boeing, that purchase hasrepercussions. The immediate impact of the higher demand from the governmentis to raise employment and profits at Boeing. Then, as the workers see higher earn-ings and the firm owners see higher profits, they respond to this increase in in-come by raising their own spending on consumer goods. As a result, thegovernment purchase from Boeing raises the demand for the products of manyother firms in the economy. Because each dollar spent by the government can raisethe aggregate demand for goods and services by more than a dollar, governmentpurchases are said to have a multiplier effect on aggregate demand.\\nThis multiplier effect continues even after this first round. When consumer\\nspending rises, the firms that produce these consumer goods hire more people andexperience higher profits. Higher earnings and profits stimulate consumer spend-ing once again, and so on. Thus, there is positive feedback as higher demand leadsto higher income, which in turn leads to even higher demand. Once all these ef-fects are added together, the total impact on the quantity of goods and servicesdemanded can be much larger than the initial impulse from higher governmentspending.\\nFigure 20-4 illustrates the multiplier effect. The increase in government pur-\\nchases of $20 billion initially shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right fromAD\\n1to AD2by exactly $20 billion. But when consumers respond by increasing\\ntheir spending, the aggregate-demand curve shifts still further to AD3.\\nThis multiplier effect arising from the response of consumer spending can be\\nstrengthened by the response of investment to higher levels of demand. For in-stance, Boeing might respond to the higher demand for planes by deciding to buymore equipment or build another plant. In this case, higher government demandspurs higher demand for investment goods. This positive feedback from demandto investment is sometimes called the investment accelerator.\\nA FORMULA FOR THE SPENDING MULTIPLIER\\nA little high school algebra permits us to derive a formula for the size of the mul-\\ntiplier effect that arises from consumer spending. An important number in this for-mula is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC )—the fraction of extra income that\\na household consumes rather than saves. For example, suppose that the marginalpropensity to consume is 3/4. This means that for every extra dollar that a house-hold earns, the household spends $0.75 (3/4 of the dollar) and saves $0.25. With anMPC of 3/4, when the workers and owners of Boeing earn $20 billion from the\\ngovernment contract, they increase their consumer spending by 3/4 /H11003 $20 billion,\\nor $15 billion.multiplier effect\\nthe additional shifts in aggregatedemand that result whenexpansionary fiscal policyincreases income and therebyincreases consumer spending458 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nTo gauge the impact on aggregate demand of a change in government pur-\\nchases, we follow the effects step-by-step. The process begins when the govern-ment spends $20 billion, which implies that national income (earnings and profits)also rises by this amount. This increase in income in turn raises consumer spend-ing by MPC /H11003 $20 billion, which in turn raises the income for the workers and\\nowners of the firms that produce the consumption goods. This second increase inincome again raises consumer spending, this time by MPC /H11003 (MPC /H11003 $20 billion).\\nThese feedback effects go on and on.\\nTo find the total impact on the demand for goods and services, we add up all\\nthese effects:\\nChange in government purchases /H11005 $20 billion\\nFirst change in consumption /H11005MPC /H11003$20 billion\\nSecond change in consumption /H11005MPC\\n2/H11003$20 billion\\nThird change in consumption /H11005MPC3/H11003$20 billion\\n••\\n••\\n••\\nTotal change in demand /H11005\\n(1 /H11001MPC /H11001MPC2/H11001MPC3/H11001· · ·)/H11003$20 billion.\\nHere, “. . .” represents an infinite number of similar terms.

For xbetween /H110021 and /H110011,\\n1 /H11001x/H11001x2/H11001x3/H11001· · · /H110051/(1 /H11002 x).\\nIn our case, x/H11005MPC. Thus,\\nMultiplier /H110051/(1 /H11002 MPC ).\\nFor example, if MPC is 3/4, the multiplier is 1/(1 /H11002 3/4), which is 4. In this case,\\nthe $20 billion of government spending generates $80 billion of demand for goodsand services.\\nThis formula for the multiplier shows an important conclusion: The size of the\\nmultiplier depends on the marginal propensity to consume. Whereas an MPC of\\n3/4 leads to a multiplier of 4, an MPC of 1/2 leads to a multiplier of only 2. Thus,\\na larger MPC means a larger multiplier. To see why this is true, remember that the\\nmultiplier arises because higher income induces greater spending on consump-tion. The larger the MPC is, the greater is this induced effect on consumption, and\\nthe larger is the multiplier.\\nOTHER APPLICATIONS OF THE MULTIPLIER EFFECT\\nBecause of the multiplier effect, a dollar of government purchases can generatemore than a dollar of aggregate demand. The logic of the multiplier effect, how-ever, is not restricted to changes in government purchases. Instead, it applies toany event that alters spending on any component of GDP—consumption, invest-ment, government purchases, or net exports.\\nFor example, suppose that a recession overseas reduces the demand for U.S.\\nnet exports by $10 billion. This reduced spending on U.S. goods and services de-presses U.S. national income, which reduces spending by U.S. consumers. If themarginal propensity to consume is 3/4 and the multiplier is 4, then the $10 billionfall in net exports means a $40 billion contraction in aggregate demand.\\nAs another example, suppose that a stock-market boom increases households’\\nwealth and stimulates their spending on goods and services by $20 billion. This ex-tra consumer spending increases national income, which in turn generates evenmore consumer spending. If the marginal propensity to consume is 3/4 and themultiplier is 4, then the initial impulse of $20 billion in consumer spending trans-lates into an $80 billion increase in aggregate demand.\\nThe multiplier is an important concept in macroeconomics because it shows\\nhow the economy can amplify the impact of changes in spending. A small initialchange in consumption, investment, government purchases, or net exports canend up having a large effect on aggregate demand and, therefore, the economy’sproduction of goods and services.460 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nTHE CROWDING-OUT EFFECT\\nThe multiplier effect seems to suggest that when the government buys $20 billion\\nof planes from Boeing, the resulting expansion in aggregate demand is necessarilylarger than $20 billion. Yet another effect is working in the opposite direction.While an increase in government purchases stimulates the aggregate demand forgoods and services, it also causes the interest rate to rise, and a higher interest ratereduces investment spending and chokes off aggregate demand. The reduction inaggregate demand that results when a fiscal expansion raises the interest rate iscalled the crowding-out effect.\\nTo see why crowding out occurs, let’s consider what happens in the money\\nmarket when the government buys planes from Boeing. As we have discussed,this increase in demand raises the incomes of the workers and owners of this firm(and, because of the multiplier effect, of other firms as well). As incomes rise,households plan to buy more goods and services and, as a result, choose to holdmore of their wealth in liquid form. That is, the increase in income caused by thefiscal expansion raises the demand for money.\\nThe effect of the increase in money demand is shown in panel (a) of Fig-\\nure 20-5. Because the Fed has not changed the money supply, the vertical supplycurve remains the same. When the higher level of income shifts the money-demand curve to the right from MD\\n1to MD2, the interest rate must rise from r1to\\nr2to keep supply and demand in balance.\\nThe increase in the interest rate, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and ser-\\nvices demanded. In particular, because borrowing is more expensive, the demandfor residential and business investment goods declines. That is, as the increase ingovernment purchases increases the demand for goods and services, it may alsocrowd out investment. This crowding-out effect partially offsets the impact of gov-ernment purchases on aggregate demand, as illustrated in panel (b) of Figure 20-5.The initial impact of the increase in government purchases is to shift the aggregate-demand curve from AD\\n1to AD2, but once crowding out takes place, the aggregate-\\ndemand curve drops back to AD3.\\nTo sum up: When the government increases its purchases by $20 billion, the aggre-\\ngate demand for goods and services could rise by more or less than $20 billion, dependingon whether the multiplier effect or the crowding-out effect is larger.\\nCHANGES IN TAXES\\nThe other important instrument of fiscal policy, besides the level of governmentpurchases, is the level of taxation. When the government cuts personal incometaxes, for instance, it increases households’ take-home pay. Households will savesome of this additional income, but they will also spend some of it on consumergoods. Because it increases consumer spending, the tax cut shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right. Similarly, a tax increase depresses consumer spendingand shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the left.\\nThe size of the shift in aggregate demand resulting from a tax change is also af-\\nfected by the multiplier and crowding-out effects. When the government cuts taxesand stimulates consumer spending, earnings and profits rise, which further stim-ulates consumer spending. This is the multiplier effect. At the same time, higherincome leads to higher money demand, which tends to raise interest rates. Highercrowding-out effect\\nthe offset in aggregate demand thatresults when expansionary fiscalpolicy raises the interest rate andthereby reduces investment spendingCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 461\\ninterest rates make borrowing more costly, which reduces investment spending.\\nThis is the crowding-out effect. Depending on the size of the multiplier and crowding-out effects, the shift in aggregate demand could be larger or smaller thanthe tax change that causes it.\\nIn addition to the multiplier and crowding-out effects, there is another impor-\\ntant determinant of the size of the shift in aggregate demand that results from a taxchange: households’ perceptions about whether the tax change is permanent ortemporary. For example, suppose that the government announces a tax cut of$1,000 per household. In deciding how much of this $1,000 to spend, householdsmust ask themselves how long this extra income will last.

In this case,the tax cut will have a large impact on aggregate demand. By contrast, if house-holds expect the tax change to be temporary, they will view it as adding onlyslightly to their financial resources and, therefore, will increase their spending byonly a small amount. In this case, the tax cut will have a small impact on aggregatedemand.\\nAn extreme example of a temporary tax cut was the one announced in 1992. In\\nthat year, President George Bush faced a lingering recession and an upcoming re-election campaign. He responded to these circumstances by announcing a reduc-tion in the amount of income tax that the federal government was withholdingfrom workers’ paychecks. Because legislated income tax rates did not change,however, every dollar of reduced withholding in 1992 meant an extra dollar oftaxes due on April 15, 1993, when income tax returns for 1992 were to be filed.Thus, Bush’s “tax cut” actually represented only a short-term loan from the gov-ernment. Not surprisingly, the impact of the policy on consumer spending and ag-gregate demand was relatively small.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Suppose that the government reduces spending on highway\\nconstruction by $10 billion.

C1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nJapan Tries a \\nFiscal StimulusCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 463\\nUSING POLICY TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY\\nWe have seen how monetary and fiscal policy can affect the economy’s aggregate\\ndemand for goods and services. These theoretical insights raise some importantpolicy questions: Should policymakers use these instruments to control aggregatedemand and stabilize the economy? If so, when? If not, why not?\\nTHE CASE FOR ACTIVE STABILIZATION POLICY\\nLet’s return to the question that began this chapter: When the president and Con-gress cut government spending, how should the Federal Reserve respond? As we have seen, government spending is one determinant of the position of the aggregate-demand curve. When the government cuts spending, aggregate demandwill fall, which will depress production and employment in the short run. If the Federal Reserve wants to prevent this adverse effect of the fiscal policy, it can actto expand aggregate demand by increasing the money supply. A monetary expan-sion would reduce interest rates, stimulate investment spending, and expand ag-gregate demand. If monetary policy responds appropriately, the combinedchanges in monetary and fiscal policy could leave the aggregate demand for goodsand services unaffected.\\nThis analysis is exactly the sort followed by members of the Federal Open\\nMarket Committee. They know that monetary policy is an important determinant\\nSo far our discussion of fis-\\ncal policy has stressed howchanges in government pur-chases and changes in taxes in-fluence the quantity of goodsand services demanded. Mosteconomists believe that theshort-run macroeconomic ef-fects of fiscal policy workprimarily through aggregatedemand. Yet fiscal policy canpotentially also influence thequantity of goods and ser-\\nvices supplied.\\nFor instance, consider the effects of tax changes on\\naggregate supply. One of the Ten Principles of Economics in\\nChapter 1 is that people respond to incentives. When gov-ernment policymakers cut tax rates, workers get to keepmore of each dollar they earn, so they have a greater incen-tive to work and produce goods and services. If theyrespond to this incentive, the quantity of goods and ser-vices supplied will be greater at each price level, and theaggregate-supply curve will shift to the right. Some econo-\\nmists, called supply-siders, have argued that the influence\\nof tax cuts on aggregate supply is very large. Indeed, as wediscussed in Chapter 8, some supply-siders claim the influ-ence is so large that a cut in tax rates will actually increasetax revenue by increasing worker effort. Most economists,however, believe that the supply-side effects of tax cuts aremuch smaller.\\nLike changes in taxes, changes in government pur-\\nchases can also potentially affect aggregate supply.Suppose, for instance, that the government increases ex-penditure on a form of government-provided capital, such asroads. Roads are used by private businesses to make de-liveries to their customers; an increase in the quantity ofroads increases these businesses’ productivity. Hence,when the government spends more on roads, it increasesthe quantity of goods and services supplied at any givenprice level and, thus, shifts the aggregate-supply curve tothe right. This effect on aggregate supply is probably moreimportant in the long run than in the short run, however, be-cause it would take some time for the government to buildthe new roads and put them into use.\\nFYI\\nHow Fiscal\\nPolicy Might\\nAffect\\nAggregate\\nSupply464 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nof aggregate demand. They also know that there are other important determinants\\nas well, including fiscal policy set by the president and Congress. As a result,the Fed’s Open Market Committee watches the debates over fiscal policy with akeen eye.\\nThis response of monetary policy to the change in fiscal policy is an example\\nof a more general phenomenon: the use of policy instruments to stabilize aggre-gate demand and, as a result, production and employment. Economic stabilizationhas been an explicit goal of U.S. policy since the Employment Act of 1946. This actstates that “it is the continuing policy and responsibility of the federal governmentto . . . promote full employment and production.” In essence, the government haschosen to hold itself accountable for short-run macroeconomic performance.\\nThe Employment Act has two implications. The first, more modest, implica-\\ntion is that the government should avoid being a cause of economic fluctuations.Thus, most economists advise against large and sudden changes in monetary andfiscal policy, for such changes are likely to cause fluctuations in aggregate demand.Moreover, when large changes do occur, it is important that monetary and fiscalpolicymakers be aware of and respond to the other’s actions.\\nThe second, more ambitious, implication of the Employment Act is that the\\ngovernment should respond to changes in the private economy in order to stabi-lize aggregate demand. The act was passed not long after the publication of JohnMaynard Keynes’s The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. As we\\ndiscussed in the preceding chapter, The General Theory has been one the most in-\\nfluential books ever written about economics. In it, Keynes emphasized the keyrole of aggregate demand in explaining short-run economic fluctuations. Keynesclaimed that the government should actively stimulate aggregate demand whenaggregate demand appeared insufficient to maintain production at its full-employment level.\\nKeynes (and his many followers) argued that aggregate demand fluctuates be-\\ncause of largely irrational waves of pessimism and optimism. He used the term“animal spirits” to refer to these arbitrary changes in attitude. When pessimismreigns, households reduce consumption spending, and firms reduce investmentspending. The result is reduced aggregate demand, lower production, and higherunemployment. Conversely, when optimism reigns, households and firms in-crease spending. The result is higher aggregate demand, higher production, andinflationary pressure. Notice that these changes in attitude are, to some extent, self-fulfilling.\\nIn principle, the government can adjust its monetary and fiscal policy in re-\\nsponse to these waves of optimism and pessimism and, thereby, stabilize the econ-omy. For example, when people are excessively pessimistic, the Fed can expandthe money supply to lower interest rates and expand aggregate demand. Whenthey are excessively optimistic, it can contract the money supply to raise interestrates and dampen aggregate demand. Former Fed Chairman William McChesneyMartin described this view of monetary policy very simply: “The Federal Re-serve’s job is to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going.”\\nCASE STUDY\\nKEYNESIANS IN THE WHITE HOUSE\\nWhen a reporter asked President John F. Kennedy in 1961 why he advocated a\\ntax cut, Kennedy replied, “To stimulate the economy. Don’t you remember yourCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 465\\nEconomics 101?” Kennedy’s policy was, in fact, based on the analysis of fiscal\\npolicy we have developed in this chapter. His goal was to enact a tax cut, whichwould raise consumer spending, expand aggregate demand, and increase theeconomy’s production and employment.\\nIn choosing this policy, Kennedy was relying on his team of economic ad-\\nvisers. This team included such prominent economists as James Tobin andRobert Solow, each of whom would later win a Nobel Prize for his contributionsto economics. As students in the 1940s, these economists had closely studiedJohn Maynard Keynes’s General Theory, which then was only a few years old.\\nWhen the Kennedy advisers proposed cutting taxes, they were puttingKeynes’s ideas into action.\\nAlthough tax changes can have a potent influence on aggregate demand,\\nthey have other effects as well. In particular, by changing the incentives thatpeople face, taxes can alter the aggregate supply of goods and services. Part ofthe Kennedy proposal was an investment tax credit, which gives a tax break tofirms that invest in new capital. Higher investment would not only stimulateaggregate demand immediately but would also increase the economy’s pro-ductive capacity over time. Thus, the short-run goal of increasing productionthrough higher aggregate demand was coupled with a long-run goal of in-creasing production through higher aggregate supply. And, indeed, when thetax cut Kennedy proposed was finally enacted in 1964, it helped usher in a pe-riod of robust economic growth.\\nSince the 1964 tax cut, policymakers have from time to time proposed using\\nfiscal policy as a tool for controlling aggregate demand. As we discussed earlier,President Bush attempted to speed recovery from a recession by reducing taxwithholding. Similarly, when President Clinton moved into the Oval Office in1993, one of his first proposals was a “stimulus package” of increased govern-ment spending. His announced goal was to help the U.S. economy recover morequickly from the recession it had just experienced. In the end, however, thestimulus package was defeated. Many in Congress (and many economists) con-sidered the Clinton proposal too late to be of much help, for the economy wasalready recovering as Clinton took office. Moreover, deficit reduction to en-courage long-run economic growth was considered a higher priority than ashort-run expansion in aggregate demand.\\nJOHN MAYNARD KEYNESAVISIONARY AND TWO DISCIPLES\\nJOHN F. K ENNEDY\\n BILLCLINTON466 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nTHE CASE AGAINST ACTIVE STABILIZATION POLICY\\nSome economists argue that the government should avoid active use of monetary\\nand fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. They claim that these policy in-struments should be set to achieve long-run goals, such as rapid economic growthand low inflation, and that the economy should be left to deal with short-run fluc-tuations on its own. Although these economists may admit that monetary and fis-cal policy can stabilize the economy in theory, they doubt whether it can do so inpractice.\\nThe primary argument against active monetary and fiscal policy is that these\\npolicies affect the economy with a substantial lag. As we have seen, monetary pol-icy works by changing interest rates, which in turn influence investment spending.But many firms make investment plans far in advance. Thus, most economists be-lieve that it takes at least six months for changes in monetary policy to have mucheffect on output and employment. Moreover, once these effects occur, they can lastfor several years. Critics of stabilization policy argue that because of this lag, theFed should not try to fine-tune the economy. They claim that the Fed often reactstoo late to changing economic conditions and, as a result, ends up being a cause ofrather than a cure for economic fluctuations. These critics advocate a passive mon-etary policy, such as slow and steady growth in the money supply.\\nFiscal policy also works with a lag, but unlike the lag in monetary policy, the\\nlag in fiscal policy is largely attributable to the political process. In the UnitedStates, most changes in government spending and taxes must go through congres-sional committees in both the House and the Senate, be passed by both legislativebodies, and then be signed by the president. Completing this process can takemonths and, in some cases, years. By the time the change in fiscal policy is passedand ready to implement, the condition of the economy may well have changed.\\nThese lags in monetary and fiscal policy are a problem in part because\\neconomic forecasting is so imprecise. If forecasters could accurately predict thecondition of the economy a year in advance, then monetary and fiscal policymak-ers could look ahead when making policy decisions. In this case, policymakerscould stabilize the economy, despite the lags they face. In practice, however, majorrecessions and depressions arrive without much advance warning. The bestpolicymakers can do at any time is to respond to economic changes as they occur.\\nAUTOMATIC STABILIZERS\\nAll economists—both advocates and critics of stabilization policy—agree that thelags in implementation render policy less useful as a tool for short-run stabiliza-tion. The economy would be more stable, therefore, if policymakers could find away to avoid some of these lags. In fact, they have. Automatic stabilizers are\\nchanges in fiscal policy that stimulate aggregate demand when the economy goesinto a recession without policymakers having to take any deliberate action.\\nThe most important automatic stabilizer is the tax system. When the economy\\ngoes into a recession, the amount of taxes collected by the government falls auto-matically because almost all taxes are closely tied to economic activity. The per-sonal income tax depends on households’ incomes, the payroll tax depends onworkers’ earnings, and the corporate income tax depends on firms’ profits. Be-automatic stabilizers\\nchanges in fiscal policy thatstimulate aggregate demandwhen the economy goes into arecession without policymakershaving to take any deliberate actionCHAPTER 20 THE INFLUENCE OF MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY ON AGGREGATE DEMAND 467\\ncause incomes, earnings, and profits all fall in a recession, the government’s tax\\nrevenue falls as well. This automatic tax cut stimulates aggregate demand and,thereby, reduces the magnitude of economic fluctuations.\\nGovernment spending also acts as an automatic stabilizer. In particular, when\\nthe economy goes into a recession and workers are laid off, more people apply forunemployment insurance benefits, welfare benefits, and other forms of incomesupport. This automatic increase in government spending stimulates aggregatedemand at exactly the time when aggregate demand is insufficient to maintain fullemployment. Indeed, when the unemployment insurance system was first enactedin the 1930s, economists who advocated this policy did so in part because of itspower as an automatic stabilizer.\\nThe automatic stabilizers in the U.S. economy are not sufficiently strong to\\nprevent recessions completely. Nonetheless, without these automatic stabilizers,output and employment would probably be more volatile than they are. For thisreason, many economists oppose a constitutional amendment that would requirethe federal government always to run a balanced budget, as some politicians haveproposed. When the economy goes into a recession, taxes fall, government spend-ing rises, and the government’s budget moves toward deficit. If the governmentfaced a strict balanced-budget rule, it would be forced to look for ways to raisetaxes or cut spending in a recession. In other words, a strict balanced-budget rulewould eliminate the automatic stabilizers inherent in our current system of taxesand government spending.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Suppose a wave of negative “animal spirits” overruns the\\neconomy, and people become pessimistic about the future. What happensto aggregate demand? If the Fed wants to stabilize aggregate demand, howshould it alter the money supply? If it does this, what happens to the interestrate? Why might the Fed choose not to respond in this way?\\nCONCLUSION\\nBefore policymakers make any change in policy, they need to consider all the ef-fects of their decisions. Earlier in the book we examined classical models of theeconomy, which describe the long-run effects of monetary and fiscal policy. Therewe saw how fiscal policy influences saving, investment, the trade balance, andlong-run growth, and how monetary policy influences the price level and the in-flation rate.\\nIn this chapter we examined the short-run effects of monetary and fiscal pol-\\nicy. We saw how these policy instruments can change the aggregate demand forgoods and services and, thereby, alter the economy’s production and employmentin the short run. When Congress reduces government spending in order to balancethe budget, it needs to consider both the long-run effects on saving and growthand the short-run effects on aggregate demand and employment. When the Fedreduces the growth rate of the money supply, it must take into account the long-run effect on inflation as well as the short-run effect on production. In the nextchapter we discuss the transition between the short run and the long run more468 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nfully, and we see that policymakers often face a tradeoff between long-run and\\nshort-run goals.CLOSELY RELATED TO THE QUESTION OF\\nwhether monetary and fiscal policy\\nshould be used to stabilize the econ-omy is the question of who should setmonetary and fiscal policy. In theUnited States, monetary policy is madeby a central bank that operates free ofmost political pressures. As this opin-ion column discusses, some membersof Congress want to reduce the Fed’sindependence.Don’t Tread on the Fed\\nBYMARTIN AND KATHLEEN FELDSTEIN\\nWe and most other economists give veryhigh marks to the Federal Reserve for theway it has managed monetary policy inrecent years. Fed officials have very suc-cessfully carried out their responsibility toreduce the rate of inflation and have doneso without interrupting the economic ex-pansion that began back in 1991.\\nDespite that excellent record, there\\nare influential figures in Congress whoare planning to introduce legislation thatwould weaken the Federal Reserve’s abil-ity to continue to make sound monetarypolicy decisions. That legislation wouldgive Congress and the president moreinfluence over Federal Reserve policy,making monetary policy responsive topolitical pressures. If that happened, therisk of higher inflation and of increasedcyclical volatility would become muchgreater.\\nTo achieve the good economic per-\\nformance of the past five years, the Fedhad to raise interest rates several timesin 1994 and, more recently, has had to\\navoid political calls for easier moneyto speed up the pace of economic activ-ity. Looking ahead, the economy mayslow in the next year. If it does, you canexpect to hear members of Congressand maybe the White House urging theFed to lower interest rates in orderto maintain economic momentum. Butwe’re betting that, even if the economydoes slow, the inflationary pressures arebuilding and will force the Fed to raise in-terest rates by early in the new year.\\nIf the Fed does raise interest rates\\nin order to prevent a rise in inflation, theincreased political pressure on the Fedmay find popular support. There is alwayspublic resistance to higher interest rates,which make borrowing more expensivefor both businesses and homeowners.Moreover, the purpose of higher interestrates would be to slow the growth ofspending in order to prevent an overheat-ing of demand.

Monetary pol-icy and short-term interest rates aredetermined by the Federal Open MarketCommittee (the FOMC), which consistsof the 7 governors of the Fed plus the 12presidents of the regional Federal Re-serve Banks. The regional presidentsvote on an alternating basis but all partic-ipate in the deliberations.\\nA key to the independence of the\\nFed’s actions lies in the manner that ap-pointments are made within the system.Although the 7 Federal Reserve gover-nors are appointed by the president andconfirmed by the Senate, each of the 12Federal Reserve presidents is selectedby the local board of a regional FederalReserve Bank rather than being respon-sive to Washington. These regional pres-idents often serve for many years.Frequently they are long-term employeesof the Federal Reserve system who haverisen through the ranks. And many areprofessional economists with expertise in\\nmonetary economics. But whatever theirbackgrounds, they are not political ap-pointees or friends of elected politicians.Their allegiance is to the goal of soundmonetary policy, including both macro-economic performance and supervisionof the banking system.\\nThe latest challenge to Fed indepen-\\ndence would be to deny these FederalReserve presidents the power to vote onmonetary policy. This bad idea, explicitlyproposed by Senator Paul Sarbanes, apowerful Democrat on the Senate Bank-ing Committee, would mean shifting all ofthe authority to the 7 governors. Be-cause at least one governor’s term endsevery two years, a president who spendseight years in the White House wouldbe able to appoint a majority of the Boardof Governors and could thus controlmonetary policy. An alternative badidea, proposed by Representative HenryGonzalez, a key Democrat on the HouseBanking Committee, would take awaythe independence of the Fed by hav-ing the regional Fed presidents ap-pointedby the presid ent subject to Sen-\\nate confirmation.\\nEither approach would inevitably\\nmean more politicalization of FederalReserve policy. In an economy that isstarting to overheat, the temptationwould be to resist raising interest ratesand to risk an acceleration of inflation. Inthe long run, that would mean volatile in-terest rates and less stability in the over-all economy.\\nIronically, such a move toward cut-\\nting the independence of the FederalReserve is just counter to developmentsin other countries. Experience around theworld has confirmed that the indepen-dence of central banks such as our Fedis the key to sound monetary policy.It would be a serious mistake for theUnited States to move in the oppositedirection.\\nSOURCE :The Boston Globe, November 12, 1996,\\np.

We saw that the natural rate of unemploy-ment depends on various features of the labor market, such as minimum-wagelaws, the market power of unions, the role of efficiency wages, and the effective-ness of job search. By contrast, the inflation rate depends primarily on growth inTHE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF\\nBETWEEN INFLATION\\nAND UNEMPLOYMENT\\n473474 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nthe money supply, which a nation’s central bank controls. In the long run, there-\\nfore, inflation and unemployment are largely unrelated problems.\\nIn the short run, just the opposite is true. One of the Ten Principles of Economics\\ndiscussed in Chapter 1 is that society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflationand unemployment. If monetary and fiscal policymakers expand aggregate de-mand and move the economy up along the short-run aggregate-supply curve, theycan lower unemployment for awhile, but only at the cost of higher inflation. If pol-icymakers contract aggregate demand and move the economy down the short-runaggregate-supply curve, they can lower inflation, but only at the cost of temporar-ily higher unemployment.\\nIn this chapter we examine this tradeoff more closely. The relationship be-\\ntween inflation and unemployment is a topic that has attracted the attention ofsome of the most important economists of the last half century. The best way to un-derstand this relationship is to see how thinking about it has evolved over time. Aswe will see, the history of thought regarding inflation and unemployment sincethe 1950s is inextricably connected to the history of the U.S. economy. These twohistories will show why the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment holdsin the short run, why it does not hold in the long run, and what issues it raises foreconomic policymakers.\\nTHE PHILLIPS CURVE\\nThe short-run relationship between inflation and unemployment is often called thePhillips curve. We begin our story with the discovery of the Phillips curve and its\\nmigration to America.\\nORIGINS OF THE PHILLIPS CURVE\\nIn 1958, economist A. W. Phillips published an article in the British journal Eco-\\nnomica that would make him famous. The article was titled “The Relationship be-\\ntween Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wages in the UnitedKingdom, 1861–1957.” In it, Phillips showed a negative correlation between therate of unemployment and the rate of inflation. That is, Phillips showed that yearswith low unemployment tend to have high inflation, and years with high unem-ployment tend to have low inflation. (Phillips examined inflation in nominalwages rather than inflation in prices, but for our purposes that distinction is notimportant. These two measures of inflation usually move together.) Phillips con-cluded that two important macroeconomic variables—inflation and unemploy-ment—were linked in a way that economists had not previously appreciated.\\nAlthough Phillips’s discovery was based on data for the United Kingdom, re-\\nsearchers quickly extended his finding to other countries. Two years after Phillipspublished his article, economists Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow published anarticle in the American Economic Review called “Analytics of Anti-Inflation Policy”\\nin which they showed a similar negative correlation between inflation and un-employment in data for the United States. They reasoned that this correlation\\nCHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 475\\narose because low unemployment was associated with high aggregate demand,\\nwhich in turn puts upward pressure on wages and prices throughout the economy.Samuelson and Solow dubbed the negative association between inflation and un-employment the Phillips curve. Figure 21-1 shows an example of a Phillips curve\\nlike the one found by Samuelson and Solow.\\nAs the title of their paper suggests, Samuelson and Solow were interested in\\nthe Phillips curve because they believed that it held important lessons for policy-makers. In particular, they suggested that the Phillips curve offers policymakers amenu of possible economic outcomes. By altering monetary and fiscal policy to in-fluence aggregate demand, policymakers could choose any point on this curve.Point A offers high unemployment and low inflation. Point B offers low unem-ployment and high inflation. Policymakers might prefer both low inflation andlow unemployment, but the historical data as summarized by the Phillips curveindicate that this combination is impossible. According to Samuelson and Solow,policymakers face a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and thePhillips curve illustrates that tradeoff.\\nAGGREGATE DEMAND, AGGREGATE SUPPLY,\\nAND THE PHILLIPS CURVE\\nThe model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply provides an easy explana-\\ntion for the menu of possible outcomes described by the Phillips curve. The Phillips\\ncurve simply shows the combinations of inflation and unemployment that arise in theshort run as shifts in the aggregate-demand curve move the economy along the short-runaggregate-supply curve. As we saw in Chapter 19, an increase in the aggregate de-\\nmand for goods and services leads, in the short run, to a larger output of goodsand services and a higher price level. Larger output means greater employmentPhillips curve\\na curve that shows the short-runtradeoff between inflation andunemployment\\nUnemployment\\nRate (percent)04 7Inflation\\nRate\\n(percent\\nper year)\\nB\\nA6\\n2\\nPhillips curveFigure 21-1\\nTHEPHILLIPS CURVE . The\\nPhillips curve illustratesa negative association betweenthe inflation rate and theunemployment rate. Atpoint A, inflation is low andunemployment is high. Atpoint B, inflation is highand unemployment is low.476 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nand, thus, a lower rate of unemployment. In addition, whatever the previous\\nyear’s price level happens to be, the higher the price level in the current year, thehigher the rate of inflation. Thus, shifts in aggregate demand push inflation andunemployment in opposite directions in the short run—a relationship illustratedby the Phillips curve.\\nTo see more fully how this works, let’s consider an example. To keep the num-\\nbers simple, imagine that the price level (as measured, for instance, by the con-sumer price index) equals 100 in the year 2000. Figure 21-2 shows two possibleoutcomes that might occur in year 2001. Panel (a) shows the two outcomes usingthe model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Panel (b) illustrates thesame two outcomes using the Phillips curve.\\nIn panel (a) of the figure, we can see the implications for output and the price\\nlevel in the year 2001. If the aggregate demand for goods and services is relativelylow, the economy experiences outcome A. The economy produces output of 7,500,and the price level is 102. By contrast, if aggregate demand is relatively high, theeconomy experiences outcome B. Output is 8,000, and the price level is 106. Thus,higher aggregate demand moves the economy to an equilibrium with higher out-put and a higher price level.\\nQuantity\\nof Output8,000 7,500 0106\\n102Short-run\\naggregate\\nsupply(a) The Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply \\nUnemployment\\nRate (percent)0Inflation\\nRate\\n(percent\\nper year)Price\\nLevel(b) The Phillips Curve\\n4\\n(output is\\n8,000)7\\n(output is\\n7,500)B\\nA6\\n2\\nPhillips curveAB\\nLow aggregate\\ndemandHigh\\naggregate demand\\n(unemployment\\nis 7%)(unemployment\\n is 4%)\\nFigure 21-2HOW THE PHILLIPS CURVE ISRELATED TO THE MODEL OF AGGREGATE DEMAND\\nAND AGGREGATE SUPPLY . This figure assumes a price level of 100 for the year 2000 and\\ncharts possible outcomes for the year 2001. Panel (a) shows the model of aggregatedemand and aggregate supply. If aggregate demand is low, the economy is at point A;output is low (7,500), and the price level is low (102). If aggregate demand is high, theeconomy is at point B; output is high (8,000), and the price level is high (106). Panel (b)shows the implications for the Phillips curve. Point A, which arises when aggregatedemand is low, has high unemployment (7 percent) and low inflation (2 percent). Point B,which arises when aggregate demand is high, has low unemployment (4 percent) and\\nhigh inflation (6 percent).CHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 477\\nIn panel (b) of the figure, we can see what these two possible outcomes mean\\nfor unemployment and inflation. Because firms need more workers when theyproduce a greater output of goods and services, unemployment is lower in out-come B than in outcome A. In this example, when output rises from 7,500 to 8,000,unemployment falls from 7 percent to 4 percent. Moreover, because the price levelis higher at outcome B than at outcome A, the inflation rate (the percentage changein the price level from the previous year) is also higher. In particular, since theprice level was 100 in year 2000, outcome A has an inflation rate of 2 percent, andoutcome B has an inflation rate of 6 percent. Thus, we can compare the two possi-ble outcomes for the economy either in terms of output and the price level (usingthe model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply) or in terms of unemploy-ment and inflation (using the Phillips curve).\\nAs we saw in the preceding chapter, monetary and fiscal policy can shift\\nthe aggregate-demand curve. Therefore, monetary and fiscal policy can move theeconomy along the Phillips curve. Increases in the money supply, increases ingovernment spending, or cuts in taxes expand aggregate demand and move theeconomy to a point on the Phillips curve with lower unemployment and higherinflation. Decreases in the money supply, cuts in government spending, or in-creases in taxes contract aggregate demand and move the economy to a pointon the Phillips curve with lower inflation and higher unemployment. In this sense,the Phillips curve offers policymakers a menu of combinations of inflation andunemployment.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the Phillips curve. Use the model of aggregate\\ndemand and aggregate supply to show how policy can move the economyfrom a point on this curve with high inflation to a point with low inflation.\\nSHIFTS IN THE PHILLIPS CURVE:\\nTHE ROLE OF EXPECTATIONS\\nThe Phillips curve seems to offer policymakers a menu of possible inflation-\\nunemployment outcomes. But does this menu remain stable over time? Is thePhillips curve a relationship on which policymakers can rely? Economists took upthese questions in the late 1960s, shortly after Samuelson and Solow had intro-duced the Phillips curve into the macroeconomic policy debate.\\nTHE LONG-RUN PHILLIPS CURVE\\nIn 1968 economist Milton Friedman published a paper in the American Economic\\nReview, based on an address he had recently given as president of the American\\nEconomic Association. The paper, titled “The Role of Monetary Policy,” containedsections on “What Monetary Policy Can Do” and “What Monetary Policy CannotDo.” Friedman argued that one thing monetary policy cannot do, other than foronly a short time, is pick a combination of inflation and unemployment on thePhillips curve. At about the same time, another economist, Edmund Phelps, also478 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\npublished a paper denying the existence of a long-run tradeoff between inflation\\nand unemployment.\\nFriedman and Phelps based their conclusions on classical principles of macro-\\neconomics, which we discussed in Chapters 12 through 18. Recall that classicaltheory points to growth in the money supply as the primary determinant of infla-tion. But classical theory also states that monetary growth does not have real ef-fects—it merely alters all prices and nominal incomes proportionately. Inparticular, monetary growth does not influence those factors that determine theeconomy’s unemployment rate, such as the market power of unions, the role of ef-ficiency wages, or the process of job search. Friedman and Phelps concluded thatthere is no reason to think the rate of inflation would, in the long run, be related to\\nthe rate of unemployment.\\nHere, in his own words, is Friedman’s view about what the Fed can hope to\\naccomplish in the long run:\\nThe monetary authority controls nominal quantities—directly, the quantity of its\\nown liabilities [currency plus bank reserves]. In principle, it can use this controlto peg a nominal quantity—an exchange rate, the price level, the nominal level ofnational income, the quantity of money by one definition or another—or to pegthe change in a nominal quantity—the rate of inflation or deflation, the rate ofACCORDING TO THE PHILLIPS CURVE , WHEN\\nunemployment falls to low levels,wages and prices start to rise morequickly. The following article illustratesthis link between labor-market condi-tions and inflation.\\nTighter Labor Market\\nWidens Inflation Fears\\nBYROBERT D.

In particular, they\\nimply that monetary policymakers face a long-run Phillips curve that is vertical, asin Figure 21-3. If the Fed increases the money supply slowly, the inflation rate islow, and the economy finds itself at point A. If the Fed increases the money supplyquickly, the inflation rate is high, and the economy finds itself at point B. In eithercase, the unemployment rate tends toward its normal level, called the natural rate\\nof unemployment. The vertical long-run Phillips curve illustrates the conclusion that\\nunemployment does not depend on money growth and inflation in the long run.\\nThe vertical long-run Phillips curve is, in essence, one expression of the classi-\\ncal idea of monetary neutrality. As you may recall, we expressed this idea in Chap-ter 19 with a vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve. Indeed, as Figure 21-4illustrates, the vertical long-run Phillips curve and the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve are two sides of the same coin. In panel (a) of this figure, an increasein the money supply shifts the aggregate-demand curve to the right from AD\\n1financial economist at Keycorp, a Cleve-\\nland bank, “at a time when revenuegrowth is constrained.”\\nBut with unemployment already at a\\nlow 5.5 percent and the economy lookingstronger than expected this summer,more analysts are worried that it may beonly a matter of time before wage pres-sures begin to build again as they did inthe late 1980s. . . .\\nThe labor shortages are wide-\\nspread and include both skilled andunskilled jobs. Among the hardest oc-cupations to fill are computer analystand programmer, aerospace engineer,construction trades worker, and varioustypes of salespeople. But even fastfood establishments in the St. Louisarea and elsewhere have resorted tosigning bonuses as well as premium payand more generous benefits to attractapplicants. . . .\\nSo far, upward pressure on pay is\\nrelatively modest, a phenomenon thateconomists say is surprising in light of anuninterrupted business expansion that is\\nnow five and a half years old.\\n“We have less wage pressure\\nthan, historically, anyone would haveguessed,” said Stuart G. Hoffman, chiefeconomist at PNC Bank in Pittsburgh.\\nBut wages have already crept up\\na bit and could accelerate even if theeconomy slackens from its recent rapidgrowth pace. And if the economymaintains significant momentum, someanalysts say, all bets are off. If growthcontinues another six months at above2.5 percent or so, Mark Zandi, chiefeconomist for Regional Financial Associ-ates, said, “we’ll be looking at wage infla-tion right square in the eye.” . . .[\\nAuthor’s note: In fact, wage inflation did\\nrise. The rate of increase in compensationper hour paid by U.S. businesses rosefrom 1.8 percent in 1994 to 4.4 percent in1998.

D1.480 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\ntoAD2. As a result of this shift, the long-run equilibrium moves from point A to\\npoint B. The price level rises from P1to P2, but because the aggregate-supply curve\\nis vertical, output remains the same. In panel (b), more rapid growth in the moneysupply raises the inflation rate by moving the economy from point A to point B.But because the Phillips curve is vertical, the rate of unemployment is the same atthese two points. Thus, the vertical long-run aggregate-supply curve and the ver-tical long-run Phillips curve both imply that monetary policy influences nominalvariables (the price level and the inflation rate) but not real variables (output andunemployment). Regardless of the monetary policy pursued by the Fed, outputand unemployment are, in the long run, at their natural rates.\\nWhat is so “natural” about the natural rate of unemployment? Friedman and\\nPhelps used this adjective to describe the unemployment rate toward which theeconomy tends to gravitate in the long run. Yet the natural rate of unemploymentis not necessarily the socially desirable rate of unemployment. Nor is the naturalrate of unemployment constant over time. For example, suppose that a newlyformed union uses its market power to raise the real wages of some workers abovethe equilibrium level. The result is a surplus of workers and, therefore, a highernatural rate of unemployment. This unemployment is “natural” not because it isgood but because it is beyond the influence of monetary policy. More rapid moneygrowth would not reduce the market power of the union or the level of unem-ployment; it would lead only to more inflation.\\nAlthough monetary policy cannot influence the natural rate of unemploy-\\nment, other types of policy can. To reduce the natural rate of unemployment,policymakers should look to policies that improve the functioning of the labormarket. Earlier in the book we discussed how various labor-market policies, suchas minimum-wage laws, collective-bargaining laws, unemployment insurance,and job-training programs, affect the natural rate of unemployment.

In addition, because lower unemployment means more\\nworkers are producing goods and services, the quantity of goods and servicessupplied would be larger at any given price level, and the long-run aggregate-supply curve would shift to the right. The economy could then enjoy lower unem-ployment and higher output for any given rate of money growth and inflation.\\nEXPECTATIONS AND THE SHORT-RUN PHILLIPS CURVE\\nAt first, the denial by Friedman and Phelps of a long-run tradeoff between infla-tion and unemployment might not seem persuasive. Their argument was based onan appeal to theory. By contrast, the negative correlation between inflation and un-\\nemployment documented by Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow was based on data.\\nWhy should anyone believe that policymakers faced a vertical Phillips curve whenthe world seemed to offer a downward-sloping one?

The price level rises from P1to P2, while output remains\\nthe same. Panel (b) shows the long-run Phillips curve, which is vertical at the natural rate of unemployment. Expansionary monetary policy moves the economy from lower inflation (point A) to higher inflation (point B) without changing the rate of\\nunemployment.482 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nFriedman and Phelps were well aware of these questions, and they offered \\na way to reconcile classical macroeconomic theory with the finding of a down-ward-sloping Phillips curve in data from the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates. They claimed that a negative relationship between inflation and unem-ployment holds in the short run but that it cannot be used by policymakers in thelong run. In other words, policymakers can pursue expansionary monetary policyto achieve lower unemployment for a while, but eventually unemployment re-turns to its natural rate, and more expansionary monetary policy leads only tohigher inflation.\\nFriedman and Phelps reasoned as we did in Chapter 19 when we explained\\nthe difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate-supply curves. (Infact, the discussion in that chapter drew heavily on the legacy of Friedman andPhelps.) As you may recall, the short-run aggregate-supply curve is upward sloping, indicating that an increase in the price level raises the quantity of goodsand services that firms supply. By contrast, the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, indicating that the price level does not influence quantity supplied in thelong run. Chapter 19 presented three theories to explain the upward slope of the short-run aggregate-supply curve: misperceptions about relative prices, sticky wages, and sticky prices. Because perceptions, wages, and prices adjust to changing economic conditions over time, the positive relationship between theprice level and quantity supplied applies in the short run but not in the long run. Friedman and Phelps applied this same logic to the Phillips curve. Just as the aggregate-supply curve slopes upward only in the short run, the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment holds only in the short run. And just as the long-run aggregate-supply curve is vertical, the long-run Phillips curve is also vertical.\\nTo help explain the short-run and long-run relationship between inflation and\\nunemployment, Friedman and Phelps introduced a new variable into the analysis:expected inflation. Expected inflation measures how much people expect the overall\\nprice level to change. As we discussed in Chapter 19, the expected price level af-fects the perceptions of relative prices that people form and the wages and pricesthat they set. As a result, expected inflation is one factor that determines the posi-tion of the short-run aggregate-supply curve. In the short run, the Fed can take ex-pected inflation (and thus the short-run aggregate-supply curve) as alreadydetermined. When the money supply changes, the aggregate-demand curve shifts,and the economy moves along a given short-run aggregate-supply curve. In theshort run, therefore, monetary changes lead to unexpected fluctuations in output,prices, unemployment, and inflation. In this way, Friedman and Phelps explainedthe Phillips curve that Phillips, Samuelson, and Solow had documented.\\nYet the Fed’s ability to create unexpected inflation by increasing the money\\nsupply exists only in the short run. In the long run, people come to expect what-ever inflation rate the Fed chooses to produce. Because perceptions, wages, andprices will eventually adjust to the inflation rate, the long-run aggregate-supplycurve is vertical. In this case, changes in aggregate demand, such as those due tochanges in the money supply, do not affect the economy’s output of goods andservices. Thus, Friedman and Phelps concluded that unemployment returns to itsnatural rate in the long run.\\nThe analysis of Friedman and Phelps can be summarized in the following\\nequation (which is, in essence, another expression of the aggregate-supply equa-tion we saw in Chapter 19):CHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 483\\n/H11005/H11002 a/H20898/H11002 /H20899.\\nThis equation relates the unemployment rate to the natural rate of unemployment,\\nactual inflation, and expected inflation. In the short run, expected inflation isgiven. As a result, higher actual inflation is associated with lower unemployment.(How much unemployment responds to unexpected inflation is determined by thesize of a,a number that in turn depends on the slope of the short-run aggregate-\\nsupply curve.) In the long run, however, people come to expect whatever inflationthe Fed produces. Thus, actual inflation equals expected inflation, and unemploy-ment is at its natural rate.\\nThis equation implies there is no stable short-run Phillips curve. Each short-\\nrun Phillips curve reflects a particular expected rate of inflation. (To be precise, ifyou graph the equation, you’ll find that the short-run Phillips curve intersects thelong-run Phillips curve at the expected rate of inflation.) Whenever expected in-flation changes, the short-run Phillips curve shifts.\\nAccording to Friedman and Phelps, it is dangerous to view the Phillips curve\\nas a menu of options available to policymakers. To see why, imagine an economyat its natural rate of unemployment with low inflation and low expected inflation,shown in Figure 21-5 as point A. Now suppose that policymakers try to take ad-vantage of the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment by using monetaryor fiscal policy to expand aggregate demand. In the short run when expected in-flation is given, the economy goes from point A to point B. Unemployment falls be-low its natural rate, and inflation rises above expected inflation. Over time, peopleget used to this higher inflation rate, and they raise their expectations of inflation.When expected inflation rises, firms and workers start taking higher inflation intoExpected\\ninflationActual\\ninflationNatural rate of\\nunemploymentUnemployment\\nrate\\nUnemployment\\nRate0 Natural rate of\\nunemploymentInflation\\nRate\\nCBLong-run\\nPhillips curve\\nAShort-run Phillips curve\\nwith high expected\\ninflation\\nShort-run Phillips curve\\nwith low expected\\ninflation1.

The short-run Phillips curve then shifts to\\nthe right, as shown in the figure. The economy ends up at point C, with higher in-flation than at point A but with the same level of unemployment.\\nThus, Friedman and Phelps concluded that policymakers do face a tradeoff be-\\ntween inflation and unemployment, but only a temporary one. If policymakers usethis tradeoff, they lose it.\\nTHE NATURAL EXPERIMENT\\nFOR THE NATURAL-RATE HYPOTHESIS\\nFriedman and Phelps had made a bold prediction in 1968: If policymakers try to\\ntake advantage of the Phillips curve by choosing higher inflation in order to re-duce unemployment, they will succeed at reducing unemployment only tem-porarily. This view—that unemployment eventually returns to its natural rate,regardless of the rate of inflation—is called the natural-rate hypothesis. A few\\nyears after Friedman and Phelps proposed this hypothesis, monetary and fiscalpolicymakers inadvertently created a natural experiment to test it. Their labora-tory was the U.S. economy.\\nBefore we see the outcome of this test, however, let’s look at the data that\\nFriedman and Phelps had when they made their prediction in 1968. Figure 21-6shows the unemployment rate and the inflation rate for the period from 1961 to1968. These data trace out a Phillips curve. As inflation rose over these eight years,unemployment fell. The economic data from this era seemed to confirm the trade-off between inflation and unemployment.\\nThe apparent success of the Phillips curve in the 1960s made the prediction of\\nFriedman and Phelps all the more bold. In 1958 Phillips had suggested a negativenatural-rate hypothesis\\nthe claim that unemploymenteventually returns to its normal,or natural, rate, regardless ofthe rate of inflation\\nUnemployment\\nRate (percent)Inflation Rate\\n(percent per year)\\n1968\\n1966\\n19611962\\n19631967\\n1965\\n1964\\n123456789 1 0 0246810Figure 21-6\\nTHEPHILLIPS CURVE\\nIN THE 1960 S.

In 1960 Samuelson and Solow\\nhad showed it existed in U.S. data. Another decade of data had confirmed the re-lationship. To some economists at the time, it seemed ridiculous to claim that thePhillips curve would break down once policymakers tried to use it.\\nBut, in fact, that is exactly what happened. Beginning in the late 1960s, the\\ngovernment followed policies that expanded the aggregate demand for goods andservices. In part, this expansion was due to fiscal policy: Government spendingrose as the Vietnam War heated up. In part, it was due to monetary policy: Becausethe Fed was trying to hold down interest rates in the face of expansionary fiscalpolicy, the money supply (as measured by M2) rose about 13 percent per year dur-ing the period from 1970 to 1972, compared to 7 percent per year in the early 1960s.As a result, inflation stayed high (about 5 to 6 percent per year in the late 1960s andearly 1970s, compared to about 1 to 2 percent per year in the early 1960s). But, asFriedman and Phelps had predicted, unemployment did not stay low.\\nFigure 21-7 displays the history of inflation and unemployment from 1961 to\\n1973. It shows that the simple negative relationship between these two variablesstarted to break down around 1970. In particular, as inflation remained high in theearly 1970s, people’s expectations of inflation caught up with reality, and the un-employment rate reverted to the 5 percent to 6 percent range that had prevailed inthe early 1960s. Notice that the history illustrated in Figure 21-7 closely resemblesthe theory of a shifting short-run Phillips curve shown in Figure 21-5. By 1973,policymakers had learned that Friedman and Phelps were right: There is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Draw the short-run Phillips curve and the long-run Phillips\\ncurve.

In the 1990s, the opposite oc-curred, as expected inflation fell andhelped keep actual inflation low.\\nThe Virtuous Circle\\nof Low Inflation\\nBYJACOB M. S CHLESINGER\\nWhy does inflation remain so low?\\nSome experts credit greater cor-\\nporate efficiency. Others cite a growinglabor force. Luck, in the form of cheap oiland a strong dollar, helps. But the ragingeconomic debate often overlooks onesimple answer: because inflation remainsso low. In other words, it isn’t just a mat-ter of mathematical formulas such as aPhillips-curve tradeoff between inflationand jobs; it also is the nebulous matter ofmass psychology. The economy may beentering a phase in which low inflation is\\nno longer considered a lucky, transitoryphenomenon but an integral part of itsfabric. And if enough executives, suppli-ers, consumers and workers believe itwill last, they will act in ways that helpmake it last.\\n“For the past couple of years, peo-\\nple were expecting inflation to rise, butit hasn’t,” says Janet Yellen, the chiefWhite House economist and former Fed-eral Reserve governor. “Slowly, peopleare being convinced that inflation isdown and it’s going to stay down,[which] is helpful in keeping inflationdown. Inflationary expectations feeddirectly into wage bargaining and pricesetting.”\\nThis substantial exorcising of the\\ninflationary specter flows partly fromthe Fed’s new credibility: a widespreadbelief that it is committed to keepingprices relatively stable and knows how todo so. . . .\\nA widely cited measure of public\\nattitudes, the University of Michigan’sSurvey of Consumers, is reflecting twosignificant changes this year, saysRichard Curtin, its director. First, long-term inflation expectations—the pre-dicted annual inflation rate for the nextfive to 10 years—have slipped below3% for the first time since the surveybegan asking the question nearly twodecades ago. Second, long-term inflationexpectations now nearly equal short-\\nterm expectations. . . .\\nThis outlook eases inflationary pres-\\nsures in many ways. Recall the 1970s,Ms. Yellen says, “when expectations offuture inflation led workers to demandwage increases that would compensatethem for expected inflation, and firms togive wage increases believing they couldpass on price increases.” . . .\\n“In the 1970s and 1980s, we had\\nprice increases baked into our projec-tions,” says Warren L. Batts, chairmanof both Premark International Inc. andTupperware Corp. and head of theNational Association of Manufacturers.“We thought we could charge our cus-tomers [more], and therefore we couldpay our suppliers. [Now], you know youcan’t charge, so you don’t pay.”\\nOf course, inflationary fears aren’t\\ncompletely cured, as last week’s stockand bond market jitters show. Rampantinflation in the 1970s shattered the no-tion that America was immune to theproblem. Remaining traces of apprehen-sion may not be all bad. “The momentwe become complacent about infla-tion,” says Deputy Treasury SecretaryLawrence Summers, “is the moment wewill start to have an inflation problem.”\\nSOURCE :The Wall Street Journal, August 18, 1997,\\np.

In 1974, the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) began to exert its market power as a cartel in the world oil mar-ket in order to increase its members’ profits. The countries of OPEC, such as SaudiArabia, Kuwait, and Iraq, restricted the amount of crude oil they pumped and soldon world markets. Within a few years, this reduction in supply caused the price ofoil to almost double.\\nA large increase in the world price of oil is an example of a supply shock.\\nAsupply shock is an event that directly affects firms’ costs of production and thus\\nthe prices they charge; it shifts the economy’s aggregate-supply curve and, as a re-sult, the Phillips curve. For example, when an oil price increase raises the cost ofproducing gasoline, heating oil, tires, and many other products, it reduces thequantity of goods and services supplied at any given price level. As panel (a) ofFigure 21-8 shows, this reduction in supply is represented by the leftward shift inthe aggregate-supply curve from AS\\n1to AS2. The price level rises from P1to P2, and\\noutput falls from Y1to Y2.

The adverse shift in aggregate supply moves the economy from apoint with lower unemployment and lower inflation (point A) to a point with higherunemployment and higher inflation (point B). The short-run Phillips curve shifts to theright from PC\\n1toPC2. Policymakers now face a worse tradeoff between inflation and\\nunemployment.488 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nThis shift in aggregate supply is associated with a similar shift in the short-run\\nPhillips curve, shown in panel (b). Because firms need fewer workers to producethe smaller output, employment falls and unemployment rises. Because the pricelevel is higher, the inflation rate—the percentage change in the price level from theprevious year—is also higher. Thus, the shift in aggregate supply leads to higherunemployment and higher inflation. The short-run tradeoff between inflation andunemployment shifts to the right from PC\\n1to PC2.\\nConfronted with an adverse shift in aggregate supply, policymakers face a dif-\\nficult choice between fighting inflation and fighting unemployment. If they con-tract aggregate demand to fight inflation, they will raise unemployment further. Ifthey expand aggregate demand to fight unemployment, they will raise inflationfurther. In other words, policymakers face a less favorable tradeoff between infla-tion and unemployment than they did before the shift in aggregate supply: Theyhave to live with a higher rate of inflation for a given rate of unemployment, ahigher rate of unemployment for a given rate of inflation, or some combination ofhigher unemployment and higher inflation.\\nAn important question is whether this adverse shift in the Phillips curve is\\ntemporary or permanent. The answer depends on how people adjust their expec-tations of inflation. If people view the rise in inflation due to the supply shock as atemporary aberration, expected inflation does not change, and the Phillips curvewill soon revert to its former position. But if people believe the shock will lead toa new era of higher inflation, then expected inflation rises, and the Phillips curveremains at its new, less desirable position.\\nIn the United States during the 1970s, expected inflation did rise substantially.\\nThis rise in expected inflation is partly attributable to the decision of the Fed to\\n“Remember the good old days when all the economy needed was a little fine-tuning?”CHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 489\\naccommodate the supply shock with higher money growth. (As we saw in Chap-\\nter 19, policymakers are said to accommodate an adverse supply shock when they\\nrespond to it by increasing aggregate demand.) Because of this policy decision, therecession that resulted from the supply shock was smaller than it otherwise mighthave been, but the U.S. economy faced an unfavorable tradeoff between inflationand unemployment for many years. The problem was compounded in 1979, whenOPEC once again started to exert its market power, more than doubling the priceof oil. Figure 21-9 shows inflation and unemployment in the U.S. economy duringthis period.\\nIn 1980, after two OPEC supply shocks, the U.S. economy had an inflation rate\\nof more than 9 percent and an unemployment rate of about 7 percent. This combi-nation of inflation and unemployment was not at all near the tradeoff that seemedpossible in the 1960s. (In the 1960s, the Phillips curve suggested that an unem-ployment rate of 7 percent would be associated with an inflation rate of only 1 per-cent. Inflation of more than 9 percent was unthinkable.) With the misery index in1980 near an historic high, the public was widely dissatisfied with the performanceof the economy. Largely because of this dissatisfaction, President Jimmy Carter losthis bid for reelection in November 1980 and was replaced by Ronald Reagan.Something had to be done, and soon it would be.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Give an example of a favorable shock to aggregate supply.\\nUse the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to explain theeffects of such a shock.

Volcker had been appointed chairman by Presi-dent Carter only two months earlier, and he had taken the job knowing that infla-tion had reached unacceptable levels. As guardian of the nation’s monetarysystem, he felt he had little choice but to pursue a policy of disinflation —a reduc-\\ntion in the rate of inflation. Volcker had no doubt that the Fed could reduce infla-tion through its ability to control the quantity of money. But what would be theshort-run cost of disinflation? The answer to this question was much less certain.\\nTHE SACRIFICE RATIO\\nTo reduce the inflation rate, the Fed has to pursue contractionary monetary policy.Figure 21-10 shows some of the effects of such a decision. When the Fed slows therate at which the money supply is growing, it contracts aggregate demand. The fallin aggregate demand, in turn, reduces the quantity of goods and services thatfirms produce, and this fall in production leads to a fall in employment. The econ-omy begins at point A in the figure and moves along the short-run Phillips curveto point B, which has lower inflation and higher unemployment. Over time, aspeople come to understand that prices are rising more slowly, expected inflation\\nWHEN PAULVOLCKER BECAME\\nFED CHAIRMAN , INFLATION WAS\\nWIDELY VIEWED AS ONE OF THENATION\\n’S FOREMOST PROBLEMS .\\nUnemployment\\nRate0 Natural rate of\\nunemploymentInflation\\nRate\\nA\\nBLong-run\\nPhillips curve\\nCShort-run Phillips curve\\nwith high expected\\ninflation\\nShort-run Phillips curve\\nwith low expected\\ninflation1.

The economy moves from\\npoint B to point C. Inflation is lower, and unemployment is back at its natural rate.\\nThus, if a nation wants to reduce inflation, it must endure a period of high un-\\nemployment and low output. In Figure 21-10, this cost is represented by the move-ment of the economy through point B as it travels from point A to point C. The sizeof this cost depends on the slope of the Phillips curve and how quickly expecta-tions of inflation adjust to the new monetary policy.\\nMany studies have examined the data on inflation and unemployment in or-\\nder to estimate the cost of reducing inflation. The findings of these studies are of-ten summarized in a statistic called the sacrifice ratio. The sacrifice ratio is the\\nnumber of percentage points of annual output lost in the process of reducing in-flation by 1 percentage point. A typical estimate of the sacrifice ratio is 5. That is,for each percentage point that inflation is reduced, 5 percent of annual outputmust be sacrificed in the transition.\\nSuch estimates surely must have made Paul Volcker apprehensive as he con-\\nfronted the task of reducing inflation. Inflation was running at almost 10 percentper year. To reach moderate inflation of, say, 4 percent per year would mean re-ducing inflation by 6 percentage points. If each percentage point cost 5 percent ofthe economy’s annual output, then reducing inflation by 6 percentage pointswould require sacrificing 30 percent of annual output.\\nAccording to studies of the Phillips curve and the cost of disinflation, this sac-\\nrifice could be paid in various ways. An immediate reduction in inflation woulddepress output by 30 percent for a single year, but that outcome was surely tooharsh even for an inflation hawk like Paul Volcker. It would be better, many ar-gued, to spread out the cost over several years. If the reduction in inflation tookplace over 5 years, for instance, then output would have to average only 6 percentbelow trend during that period to add up to a sacrifice of 30 percent. An even moregradual approach would be to reduce inflation slowly over a decade, so that out-put would have to be only 3 percent below trend. Whatever path was chosen,however, it seemed that reducing inflation would not be easy.\\nRATIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF\\nCOSTLESS DISINFLATION\\nJust as Paul Volcker was pondering how costly reducing inflation might be, a\\ngroup of economics professors was leading an intellectual revolution that wouldchallenge the conventional wisdom on the sacrifice ratio. This group includedsuch prominent economists as Robert Lucas, Thomas Sargent, and Robert Barro.Their revolution was based on a new approach to economic theory and policycalled rational expectations. According to the theory of rational expectations, peo-\\nple optimally use all the information they have, including information about gov-ernment policies, when forecasting the future.\\nThis new approach has had profound implications for many areas of macro-\\neconomics, but none is more important than its application to the tradeoff betweeninflation and unemployment. As Friedman and Phelps had first emphasized, ex-pected inflation is an important variable that explains why there is a tradeoff be-tween inflation and unemployment in the short run but not in the long run. Howquickly the short-run tradeoff disappears depends on how quickly expectationsadjust. Proponents of rational expectations built on the Friedman–Phelps analysissacrifice ratio\\nthe number of percentage pointsof annual output lost in theprocess of reducing inflationby 1 percentage point\\nrational expectations\\nthe theory according to whichpeople optimally use all theinformation they have,including information aboutgovernment policies, whenforecasting the future492 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nto argue that when economic policies change, people adjust their expectations of\\ninflation accordingly. Studies of inflation and unemployment that tried to estimatethe sacrifice ratio had failed to take account of the direct effect of the policy regimeon expectations. As a result, estimates of the sacrifice ratio were, according to therational-expectations theorists, unreliable guides for policy.\\nIn a 1981 paper titled “The End of Four Big Inflations,” Thomas Sargent de-\\nscribed this new view as follows:\\nAn alternative “rational expectations” view denies that there is any inherent\\nmomentum to the present process of inflation. This view maintains that firmsand workers have now come to expect high rates of inflation in the future andthat they strike inflationary bargains in light of these expectations. However, it isheld that people expect high rates of inflation in the future precisely because thegovernment’s current and prospective monetary and fiscal policies warrant thoseexpectations. . . . An implication of this view is that inflation can be stoppedmuch more quickly than advocates of the “momentum” view have indicated andthat their estimates of the length of time and the costs of stopping inflation interms of foregone output are erroneous. . . . This is not to say that it would beeasy to eradicate inflation. On the contrary, it would require more than a fewtemporary restrictive fiscal and monetary actions. It would require a change inthe policy regime. . . . How costly such a move would be in terms of foregoneoutput and how long it would be in taking effect would depend partly on howresolute and evident the government’s commitment was.\\nAccording to Sargent, the sacrifice ratio could be much smaller than suggested by\\nprevious estimates. Indeed, in the most extreme case, it could be zero. If thegovernment made a credible commitment to a policy of low inflation, peoplewould be rational enough to lower their expectations of inflation immediately. Theshort-run Phillips curve would shift downward, and the economy would reachlow inflation quickly without the cost of temporarily high unemployment and lowoutput.\\nTHE VOLCKER DISINFLATION\\nAs we have seen, when Paul Volcker faced the prospect of reducing inflation fromits peak of about 10 percent, the economics profession offered two conflicting pre-dictions. One group of economists offered estimates of the sacrifice ratio and con-cluded that reducing inflation would have great cost in terms of lost output andhigh unemployment. Another group offered the theory of rational expectationsand concluded that reducing inflation could be much less costly and, perhaps,could even have no cost at all. Who was right?\\nFigure 21-11 shows inflation and unemployment from 1979 to 1987. As you\\ncan see, Volcker did succeed at reducing inflation. Inflation came down from al-most 10 percent in 1981 and 1982 to about 4 percent in 1983 and 1984. Credit forthis reduction in inflation goes completely to monetary policy. Fiscal policy at thistime was acting in the opposite direction: The increases in the budget deficit dur-ing the Reagan administration were expanding aggregate demand, which tends toraise inflation. The fall in inflation from 1981 to 1984 is attributable to the toughanti-inflation policies of Fed Chairman Paul Volcker.CHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 493\\nThe figure shows that the Volcker disinflation did come at the cost of high\\nunemployment. In 1982 and 1983, the unemployment rate was about 10 percent—almost twice its level when Paul Volcker was appointed Fed chairman. At the sametime, the production of goods and services as measured by real GDP was wellbelow its trend level. (See Figure 19-1 in Chapter 19.) The Volcker disinflationproduced the deepest recession in the United States since the Great Depression ofthe 1930s.\\nDoes this experience refute the possibility of costless disinflation as suggested\\nby the rational-expectations theorists? Some economists have argued that the an-swer to this question is a resounding yes. Indeed, the pattern of disinflation shownin Figure 21-11 is very similar to the pattern predicted in Figure 21-10. To make thetransition from high inflation (point A in both figures) to low inflation (point C),the economy had to experience a painful period of high unemployment (point B).\\nYet there are two reasons not to reject the conclusions of the rational-\\nexpectations theorists so quickly. First, even though the Volcker disinflation didimpose a cost of temporarily high unemployment, the cost was not as large asmany economists had predicted. Most estimates of the sacrifice ratio based on theVolcker disinflation are smaller than estimates that had been obtained from previ-ous data. Perhaps Volcker’s tough stand on inflation did have some direct effect onexpectations, as the rational-expectations theorists claimed.\\nSecond, and more important, even though Volcker announced that he would\\naim monetary policy to lower inflation, much of the public did not believe him.Because few people thought Volcker would reduce inflation as quickly as he did,expected inflation did not fall, and the short-run Phillips curve did not shift downas quickly as it might have.

Thus, the Volcker disinflationdoes not necessarily refute the rational-expectations view that credible disinflationcan be costless. It does show, however, that policymakers cannot count on peopleimmediately believing them when they announce a policy of disinflation.\\nTHE GREENSPAN ERA\\nSince the OPEC inflation of the 1970s and the Volcker disinflation of the 1980s, theU.S. economy has experienced relatively mild fluctuations in inflation and unem-ployment. Figure 21-12 shows inflation and unemployment from 1984 to 1999.This period is called the Greenspan era, after Alan Greenspan who in 1987 fol-lowed Paul Volcker as chairman of the Federal Reserve.\\nThis period began with a favorable supply shock. In 1986, OPEC members\\nstarted arguing over production levels, and their long-standing agreement to re-strict supply broke down. Oil prices fell by about half. As the figure shows, this fa-vorable supply shock led to falling inflation and falling unemployment.\\nSince then, the Fed has been careful to avoid repeating the policy mistakes of\\nthe 1960s, when excessive aggregate demand pushed unemployment below thenatural rate and raised inflation. When unemployment fell and inflation rose in1989 and 1990, the Fed raised interest rates and contracted aggregate demand,leading to a small recession in 1991. Unemployment then rose above most esti-mates of the natural rate, and inflation fell once again.\\nUnemployment\\nRate (percent)Inflation Rate\\n(percent per year)\\n19841991\\n1985\\n1992\\n1986\\n199319941988\\n1987\\n1995\\n19961997\\n1998199919891990\\n123456789 1 0 0246810Figure 21-12\\nTHEGREENSPAN ERA.

In 1999,for instance, unemployment had fallen to 4.2 percent, while inflation wasrunning a mere 1.3 percent per year. As measured by these two importantmacroeconomic variables, the United States was enjoying a period of unusualprosperity.\\nSome observers argued that this experience cast doubt on the theory of the\\nPhillips curve. Indeed, the combination of low inflation and low unemploymentmight seem to suggest that there was no longer a tradeoff between thesetwo variables. Yet most economists took a less radical view of events. As wehave discussed throughout this chapter, the short-run tradeoff between infla-tion and unemployment shifts over time. In the 1990s, this tradeoff shifted left-ward, allowing the economy to enjoy low unemployment and low inflationsimultaneously.\\nWhat caused this favorable shift in the short-run Phillips curve? Part of the\\nanswer lies in a fall in expected inflation. Under Paul Volcker and AlanGreenspan, the Fed pursued a policy aimed at reducing inflation and keeping itlow. Over time, as this policy succeeded, the Fed gained credibility with thepublic that it would continue to fight inflation as necessary. The increased cred-ibility lowered inflation expectations, which shifted the short-run Phillips curveto the left.\\nIn addition to this shift from reduced expected inflation, many economists\\nbelieve that the U.S. economy experienced some favorable supply shocksduring this period. (Recall that a favorable supply shock shifts the short-runaggregate-supply curve to the right, raising output and reducing prices. Ittherefore reduces both unemployment and inflation and shifts the short-runPhillips curve to the left.) Here are three events that may get credit for thefavorable shift to aggregate supply:The rest of the 1990s witnessed a period of economic prosperity. Inflation\\ngradually drifted downward, approaching zero by the end of the decade. Unem-ployment also drifted downward, leading many observers to believe that the nat-ural rate of unemployment had fallen. Part of the credit for this good economicperformance goes to Alan Greenspan and his colleagues at the Federal Reserve, forlow inflation can be achieved only with prudent monetary policy. But as the fol-lowing case study discusses, good luck in the form of favorable supply shocks isalso part of the story.\\nWhat does the future hold? Macroeconomists are notoriously bad at fore-\\ncasting, but several lessons of the past are clear. First, as long as the Fed remainsvigilant in its control over the money supply and, thereby, aggregate demand,there is no reason to allow inflation to heat up needlessly, as it did in the late 1960s.Second, the possibility always exists for the economy to experience adverse shocksto aggregate supply, as it did in the 1970s. If that unfortunate development occurs,policymakers will have little choice but to confront a less desirable tradeoffbetween inflation and unemployment.496 PART EIGHT SHORT-RUN ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS\\nNDeclining Commodity Prices. In the late 1990s, the prices of many basic\\ncommodities fell on world markets. This fall in commodity prices, in turn,was partly due to a deep recession in Japan and other Asian economies,which reduced the demand for these products. Because commodities arean important input into production, the fall in their prices reducedproducers’ costs and acted as a favorable supply shock for the U.S.economy.\\nNLabor-Market Changes. Some economists believe that the aging of the large\\nbaby-boom generation born after World War II has caused fundamentalchanges in the labor market. Because older workers are typically in morestable jobs than younger workers, an increase in the average age of thelabor force may reduce the economy’s natural rate of unemployment.\\nNTechnological Advance. Some economists think the U.S. economy has\\nentered a period of more rapid technological progress. Advances ininformation technology, such as the Internet, have been profound andhave influenced many parts of the economy. Such technological advanceincreases productivity and, therefore, is a type of favorable supply shock.\\nEconomists debate which of these explanations of the shifting Phillips curve is\\nmost plausible. In the end, the complete story may contain elements of each.\\nKeep in mind that none of these hypotheses denies the fundamental lesson\\nof the Phillips curve—that policymakers who control aggregate demand alwaysface a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Yet the 1990sremind us that this short-run tradeoff changes over time, sometimes in waysthat are hard to predict.\\nQUICK QUIZ: What is the sacrifice ratio? How might the credibility of the\\nFed’s commitment to reduce inflation affect the sacrifice ratio?\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis chapter has examined how economists’ thinking about inflation and unem-ployment has evolved over time. We have discussed the ideas of many of the besteconomists of the twentieth century: from the Phillips curve of Phillips, Samuel-son, and Solow, to the natural-rate hypothesis of Friedman and Phelps, to therational-expectations theory of Lucas, Sargent, and Barro. Four of this group havealready won Nobel prizes for their work in economics, and more are likely to be sohonored in the years to come.\\nAlthough the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment has generated\\nmuch intellectual turmoil over the past 40 years, certain principles have developedthat today command consensus. Here is how Milton Friedman expressed the rela-tionship between inflation and unemployment in 1968:\\nThere is always a temporary tradeoff between inflation and unemployment;\\nthere is no permanent tradeoff. The temporary tradeoff comes not from inflationper se, but from unanticipated inflation, which generally means, from a risingCHAPTER 21 THE SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT 497\\nrate of inflation. The widespread belief that there is a permanent tradeoff is a\\nsophisticated version of the confusion between “high” and “rising” that we allrecognize in simpler forms. A rising rate of inflation may reduce unemployment,a high rate will not.\\nBut how long, you will say, is “temporary”? . . . I can at most venture a\\npersonal judgment, based on some examination of the historical evidence, thatthe initial effects of a higher and unanticipated rate of inflation last for somethinglike two to five years.\\nToday, more than 30 years later, this statement still summarizes the view of most\\nmacroeconomists.\\nN The Phillips curve describes a negative relationship\\nbetween inflation and unemployment. By expandingaggregate demand, policymakers can choose a point onthe Phillips curve with higher inflation and lowerunemployment. By contracting aggregate demand,policymakers can choose a point on the Phillips curvewith lower inflation and higher unemployment.\\nN The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment\\ndescribed by the Phillips curve holds only in the shortrun. In the long run, expected inflation adjusts tochanges in actual inflation, and the short-run Phillipscurve shifts. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve isvertical at the natural rate of unemployment.\\nN The short-run Phillips curve also shifts because of\\nshocks to aggregate supply. An adverse supply shock,such as the increase in world oil prices during the 1970s,\\ngives policymakers a less favorable tradeoff betweeninflation and unemployment. That is, after an adversesupply shock, policymakers have to accept a higher rateof inflation for any given rate of unemployment, or ahigher rate of unemployment for any given rate ofinflation.\\nN When the Fed contracts growth in the money supply to\\nreduce inflation, it moves the economy along the short-run Phillips curve, which results in temporarily highunemployment. The cost of disinflation depends onhow quickly expectations of inflation fall. Someeconomists argue that a credible commitment to lowinflation can reduce the cost of disinflation by inducinga quick adjustment of expectations.\\nSummary\\nPhillips curve, p. 475\\nnatural-rate hypothesis, p. 484supply shock, p. 487\\nsacrifice ratio, p. 491rational expectations, p. 491Key Concepts\\n1.

This final chapter presents both sides in five leading debates over\\nmacroeconomic policy. The knowledge you have accumulated in this course pro-vides the background with which we can discuss these important, unsettled is-sues. It should help you choose a side in these debates or, at least, help you seewhy choosing a side is so difficult.\\nSHOULD MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICYMAKERS\\nTRY TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY?\\nIn Chapters 19, 20, and 21, we saw how changes in aggregate demand and aggre-\\ngate supply can lead to short-run fluctuations in production and employment. Wealso saw how monetary and fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and, thereby,influence these fluctuations. But even if policymakers caninfluence short-run eco-\\nnomic fluctuations, does that mean they should? Our first debate concerns whether\\nmonetary and fiscal policymakers should use the tools at their disposal in an at-tempt to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle.\\nPRO: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD TRY\\nTO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY\\nLeft on their own, economies tend to fluctuate. When households and firms be-\\ncome pessimistic, for instance, they cut back on spending, and this reduces the ag-gregate demand for goods and services. The fall in aggregate demand, in turn,reduces the production of goods and services. Firms lay off workers, and the un-employment rate rises. Real GDP and other measures of income fall. Rising unem-ployment and falling income help confirm the pessimism that initially generatedthe economic downturn.\\nSuch a recession has no benefit for society—it represents a sheer waste of re-\\nsources. Workers who become unemployed because of inadequate aggregate de-mand would rather be working. Business owners whose factories are left idleduring a recession would rather be producing valuable goods and services andselling them at a profit.\\nThere is no reason for society to suffer through the booms and busts of the\\nbusiness cycle. The development of macroeconomic theory has shown policy-makers how to reduce the severity of economic fluctuations. By “leaning againstthe wind” of economic change, monetary and fiscal policy can stabilize aggregatedemand and, thereby, production and employment. When aggregate demand isinadequate to ensure full employment, policymakers should boost governmentspending, cut taxes, and expand the money supply. When aggregate demand is excessive, risking higher inflation, policymakers should cut government spending, raise taxes, and reduce the money supply. Such policy actions putmacroeconomic theory to its best use by leading to a more stable economy, whichbenefits everyone.CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 505\\nCON: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD NOT TRY\\nTO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY\\nAlthough monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy in the-\\nory, there are substantial obstacles to the use of such policies in practice.\\nOne problem is that monetary and fiscal policy do not affect the economy im-\\nmediately but instead work with a long lag. Monetary policy affects aggregate de-mand by changing interest rates, which in turn affect spending, especiallyresidential and business investment. But many households and firms set theirspending plans in advance. As a result, it takes time for changes in interest rates toalter the aggregate demand for goods and services. Many studies indicate thatchanges in monetary policy have little effect on aggregate demand until about sixmonths after the change is made.\\nFiscal policy works with a lag because of the long political process that gov-\\nerns changes in spending and taxes. To make any change in fiscal policy, a billmust go through congressional committees, pass both the House and the Senate,and be signed by the president. It can take years to propose, pass, and implementa major change in fiscal policy.\\nBecause of these long lags, policymakers who want to stabilize the economy\\nneed to look ahead to economic conditions that are likely to prevail when their ac-tions will take effect. Unfortunately, economic forecasting is highly imprecise, inpart because macroeconomics is such a primitive science and in part because theshocks that cause economic fluctuations are intrinsically unpredictable. Thus,when policymakers change monetary or fiscal policy, they must rely on educatedguesses about future economic conditions.\\nAll too often, policymakers trying to stabilize the economy do just the oppo-\\nsite. Economic conditions can easily change between the time when a policy actionbegins and when it takes effect. Because of this, policymakers can inadvertently\\n506 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nexacerbate rather than mitigate the magnitude of economic fluctuations. Some\\neconomists have claimed that many of the major economic fluctuations in history,including the Great Depression of the 1930s, can be traced to destabilizing policyactions.\\nOne of the first rules taught to physicians is “do no harm.” The human body\\nhas natural restorative powers. Confronted with a sick patient and an uncertaindiagnosis, often a doctor should do nothing but leave the patient’s body to its owndevices. Intervening in the absence of reliable knowledge merely risks makingmatters worse.\\nThe same can be said about treating an ailing economy. It might be desirable if\\npolicymakers could eliminate all economic fluctuations, but that is not a realisticgoal given the limits of macroeconomic knowledge and the inherent un-predictability of world events. Economic policymakers should refrain from inter-v\\nening often with monetary and fiscal policy and be content if they do no harm.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Explain why monetary and fiscal policy work with a lag.\\nWhy do these lags matter in the choice between active and passive policy?\\nSHOULD MONETARY POLICY BE MADE BY RULE\\nRATHER THAN BY DISCRETION?\\nAs we first discussed in Chapter 15, the Federal Open Market Committee sets\\nmonetary policy in the United States. The committee meets about every six weeks to evaluate the state of the economy. Based on this evaluation and fore-casts of future economic conditions, it chooses whether to raise, lower, or leave un-changed the level of short-term interest rates. The Fed then adjusts the money supply to reach that interest-rate target until the next meeting, when the target isreevaluated.\\nThe Federal Open Market Committee operates with almost complete discre-\\ntion over how to conduct monetary policy. The laws that created the Fed give theinstitution only vague recommendations about what goals it should pursue. Andthey do not tell the Fed how to pursue whatever goals it might choose. Once mem-bers are appointed to the Federal Open Market Committee, they have little man-date but to “do the right thing.”\\nSome economists are critical of this institutional design. Our second debate\\nover macroeconomic policy, therefore, focuses on whether the Federal Reserveshould have its discretionary powers reduced and, instead, be committed to fol-lowing a rule for how it conducts monetary policy.\\nPRO: MONETARY POLICY SHOULD BE MADE BY RULE\\nDiscretion in the conduct of monetary policy has two problems. The first is that itdoes not limit incompetence and abuse of power. When the government sendsCHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 507\\npolice into a community to maintain civic order, it gives them strict guidelines\\nabout how to carry out their job. Because police have great power, allowing themto exercise that power in whatever way they want would be dangerous. Yet whenthe government gives central bankers the authority to maintain economic order,it gives them no guidelines. Monetary policymakers are allowed undisciplineddiscretion.\\nAs an example of abuse of power, central bankers are sometimes tempted to\\nuse monetary policy to affect the outcome of elections. Suppose that the vote forthe incumbent president is based on economic conditions at the time he is up forreelection. A central banker sympathetic to the incumbent might be tempted topursue expansionary policies just before the election to stimulate production andemployment, knowing that the resulting inflation will not show up until after theelection. Thus, to the extent that central bankers ally themselves with politicians,discretionary policy can lead to economic fluctuations that reflect the electoral cal-endar. Economists call such fluctuations the political business cycle.\\nThe second, more subtle, problem with discretionary monetary policy is that\\nit might lead to more inflation than is desirable. Central bankers, knowing thatthere is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, often an-nounce that their goal is zero inflation. Yet they rarely achieve price stability.Why? Perhaps it is because, once the public forms expectations of inflation,policymakers face a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.They are tempted to renege on their announcement of price stability in order toachieve lower unemployment. This discrepancy between announcements (whatpolicymakers saythey are going to do) and actions (what they subsequently in\\nfact do) is called the time inconsistency of policy. Because policymakers are so often\\ntime inconsistent, people are skeptical when central bankers announce their in-tentions to reduce the rate of inflation. As a result, people always expect moreinflation than monetary policymakers claim they are trying to achieve. Higher ex-pectations of inflation, in turn, shift the short-run Phillips curve upward, makingthe short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment less favorable than itotherwise might be.\\nOne way to avoid these two problems with discretionary policy is to commit\\nthe central bank to a policy rule. For example, suppose that Congress passed a lawrequiring the Fed to increase the money supply by exactly 3 percent per year. (Why3 percent? Because real GDP grows on average about 3 percent per year and be-cause money demand grows with real GDP , 3 percent growth in the money supplyis roughly the rate necessary to produce long-run price stability.) Such a law wouldeliminate incompetence and abuse of power on the part of the Fed, and it wouldmake the political business cycle impossible. In addition, policy could no longer betime inconsistent. People would now believe the Fed’s announcement of low in-flation because the Fed would be legally required to pursue a low-inflation mone-tary policy. With low expected inflation, the economy would face a more favorableshort-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.\\nOther rules for monetary policy are also possible. A more active rule might al-\\nlow some feedback from the state of the economy to changes in monetary policy.For example, a more active rule might require the Fed to increase monetary growthby 1 percentage point for every percentage point that unemployment rises aboveits natural rate. Regardless of the precise form of the rule, committing the Fed tosome rule would yield advantages by limiting incompetence, abuse of power, andtime inconsistency in the conduct of monetary policy.508 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nCON: MONETARY POLICY SHOULD NOT BE MADE BY RULE\\nAlthough there may be pitfalls with discretionary monetary policy, there is also an\\nimportant advantage to it: flexibility. The Fed has to confront various circum-stances, not all of which can be foreseen. In the 1930s banks failed in record num-bers. In the 1970s the price of oil skyrocketed around the world. In October 1987the stock market fell by 22 percent in a single day. The Fed must decide how to re-spond to these shocks to the economy. A designer of a policy rule could not possi-bly consider all the contingencies and specify in advance the right policy response.It is better to appoint good people to conduct monetary policy and then give themthe freedom to do the best they can.\\nMoreover, the alleged problems with discretion are largely hypothetical. The\\npractical importance of the political business cycle, for instance, is far from clear.In some cases, just the opposite seems to occur. For example, President JimmyCarter appointed Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979. Nonetheless, inDURING THE 1990 S, MANY CENTRAL BANKS\\naround the world adopted inflation\\ntargeting as a rule—or at least as arough guide—for setting monetarypolicy. Brazil is a recent example.\\nBrazil to Use Inflation Data for\\nManaging Interest Rates\\nBYPETERFRITSCH\\nRIO DE JANEIRO —Brazil’s Central Bank\\nwill adopt in late June a formal processfor managing interest rates based onpredefined inflation targets for the fol-lowing 30 months, according to thebank’s president, Arminio Fraga.In an interview, Mr. Fraga said the\\nCentral Bank is in the process of work-ing out the details of an “inflation target-ing” regime for managing interest ratesand the economy. Inflation targeting—a system used by other countries withfree-floating currencies such as Britain,Canada, and New Zealand—is fairly sim-ple: If prices are rising faster than expec-tations, interest rates are lifted to cooloff the economy. If prices are falling orsteady, rates are cut. . . .\\nOnce in place, Brazil’s new policy\\nwill look like the Bank of England’s.Britain’s central bank hitched interest-rate policy to a more visible price anchorafter the inflationary shock of thepound’s severe weakening in 1992. To-day, the United Kingdom targets annualinflation at 2.5% over a two-year horizonand adjusts short-term interest rateswhen its price forecasts wander fromthat goal by more than a percentagepoint.\\nIn general, outside observers like\\nthe simplicity of this policy. “The ad-vantage of targeting inflation is thatthe Central Bank is less likely tomicromanage than if it is trying to target\\nthe level of interest rates or the cur-rency,” says Morgan Stanley Dean Wit-ter & Co. economist Ernest W. Brown.The downside of setting explicit targetsis that a hard-to-predict economy withoutprice controls like Brazil’s is apt to missits inflation targets from time to time, andmiss them publicly.\\nThat causes some to worry about\\nthe Brazilian Central Bank’s lack of inde-pendence. Brazil’s Central Bank reportsto the Finance Ministry, and thus to thepresident. What if missing—or hitting—an inflation target clashes with other ad-ministration goals, such as reducingunemployment? “Inflation targeting goesin the right direction of trying to insulatethe Central Bank from politics,” saysJ. P. Morgan & Co. economist MarceloCarvalho. “Still, introducing inflation tar-geting without proper formal CentralBank independence risks just pouringold wine into new bottles.”\\nSOURCE :The Wall Street Journal, May 22, 1999,\\np. A8.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nInflation TargetingCHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 509\\nOctober of that year Volcker moved to contract monetary policy to combat the\\nhigh rate of inflation that he had inherited from his predecessor. The predictableresult of Volcker’s decision was a recession, and the predictable result of the reces-sion was a decline in Carter’s popularity. Rather than using monetary policy tohelp the president who had appointed him, Volcker helped to ensure Carter’s de-feat by Ronald Reagan in the November 1980 election.\\nThe practical importance of time inconsistency is also far from clear. Although\\nmost people are skeptical of central-bank announcements, central bankers canachieve credibility over time by backing up their words with actions. In the 1990s,the Fed achieved and maintained a low rate of inflation, despite the ever presenttemptation to take advantage of the short-run tradeoff between inflation and un-employment. This experience shows that low inflation does not require that theFed be committed to a policy rule.\\nAny attempt to replace discretion with a rule must confront the difficult task\\nof specifying a precise rule. Despite much research examining the costs and bene-fits of alternative rules, economists have not reached a consensus about what agood rule would be. Until there is a consensus, society has little choice but to givecentral bankers discretion to conduct monetary policy as they see fit.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Give an example of a monetary policy rule. Why might\\nyour rule be better than discretionary policy? Why might it be worse?\\nSHOULD THE CENTRAL BANK\\nAIM FOR ZERO INFLATION?\\nOne of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and developed more\\nfully in Chapter 16, is that prices rise when the government prints too muchmoney. Another of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and de-\\nveloped more fully in Chapter 21, is that society faces a short-run tradeoff betweeninflation and unemployment. Put together, these two principles raise a questionfor policymakers: How much inflation should the central bank be willing to toler-ate? Our third debate is whether zero is the right target for the inflation rate.\\nPRO: THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD\\nAIM FOR ZERO INFLATION\\nInflation confers no benefit on society, but it imposes several real costs. As we dis-\\ncussed in Chapter 16, economists have identified six costs of inflation:\\nNShoeleather costs associated with reduced money holdings\\nNMenu costs associated with more frequent adjustment of prices\\nNIncreased variability of relative prices\\nNUnintended changes in tax liabilities due to nonindexation of the tax code\\n510 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nNConfusion and inconvenience resulting from a changing unit of account\\nNArbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with dollar-denominated debts\\nSome economists argue that these costs are small, at least for moderate rates of in-\\nflation, such as the 3 percent inflation experienced in the United States during the1990s. But other economists claim these costs can be substantial, even for moder-ate inflation. Moreover, there is no doubt that the public dislikes inflation. Wheninflation heats up, opinion polls identify inflation as one of the nation’s leadingproblems.\\nOf course, the benefits of zero inflation have to be weighed against the costs of\\nachieving it. Reducing inflation usually requires a period of high unemploymentand low output, as illustrated by the short-run Phillips curve. But this disinfla-tionary recession is only temporary. Once people come to understand that policy-makers are aiming for zero inflation, expectations of inflation will fall, and theshort-run tradeoff will improve. Because expectations adjust, there is no tradeoffbetween inflation and unemployment in the long run.\\nReducing inflation is, therefore, a policy with temporary costs and permanent\\nbenefits. That is, once the disinflationary recession is over, the benefits of zero in-flation would persist into the future. If policymakers are farsighted, they should bewilling to incur the temporary costs for the permanent benefits. This is preciselythe calculation made by Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, when he tightened mone-tary policy and reduced inflation from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 4 percentin 1983. Although in 1982 unemployment reached its highest level since the GreatDepression, the economy eventually recovered from the recession, leaving a legacyof low inflation. Today Volcker is considered a hero among central bankers.\\nMoreover, the costs of reducing inflation need not be as large as some econo-\\nmists claim. If the Fed announces a credible commitment to zero inflation, it candirectly influence expectations of inflation. Such a change in expectations can im-prove the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, allowing theeconomy to reach lower inflation at a reduced cost. The key to this strategy is cred-ibility: People must believe that the Fed is actually going to carry through on itsannounced policy. Congress could help in this regard by passing legislation thatmade price stability the Fed’s primary goal. Such a law would make it less costlyto achieve zero inflation without reducing any of the resulting benefits.\\nOne advantage of a zero-inflation target is that zero provides a more natural\\nfocal point for policymakers than any other number. Suppose, for instance, that theFed were to announce that it would keep inflation at 3 percent—the rate experi-enced during the 1990s. Would the Fed really stick to that 3 percent target? Ifevents inadvertently pushed inflation up to 4 or 5 percent, why wouldn’t they justraise the target? There is, after all, nothing special about the number 3. By contrast,zero is the only number for the inflation rate at which the Fed can claim that itachieved price stability and fully eliminated the costs of inflation.\\nCON: THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD NOT\\nAIM FOR ZERO INFLATION\\nAlthough price stability may be desirable, the benefits of zero inflation compared\\nto moderate inflation are small, whereas the costs of reaching zero inflation areCHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 511\\nlarge. Estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest that reducing inflation by 1 percent-\\nage point requires giving up about 5 percent of one year’s output. Reducing infla-tion from, say, 4 percent to zero requires a loss of 20 percent of a year’s output. Atthe current level of gross domestic product of about $9 trillion, this cost translatesinto $1.8 trillion of lost output, which is about $6,500 per person. Although peoplemight dislike inflation, it is not at all clear that they would (or should) be willingto pay this much to get rid of it.\\nThe social costs of disinflation are even larger than this $6,500 figure suggests,\\nfor the lost income is not spread equitably over the population. When the econ-omy goes into recession, all incomes do not fall proportionately. Instead, thefall in aggregate income is concentrated on those workers who lose their jobs.The vulnerable workers are often those with the least skills and experience.Hence, much of the cost of reducing inflation is borne by those who can least af-ford to pay it.\\nAlthough economists can list several costs of inflation, there is no professional\\nconsensus that these costs are substantial. The shoeleather costs, menu costs, andothers that economists have identified do not seem great, at least for moderaterates of inflation. It is true that the public dislikes inflation, but the public may bemisled into believing the inflation fallacy—the view that inflation erodes livingstandards. Economists understand that living standards depend on productivity,not monetary policy. Because inflation in nominal incomes goes hand in hand withinflation in prices, reducing inflation would not cause real incomes to rise morerapidly.\\nMoreover, policymakers can reduce many of the costs of inflation without ac-\\ntually reducing inflation. They can eliminate the problems associated with thenonindexed tax system by rewriting the tax laws to take account of the effects ofinflation. They can also reduce the arbitrary redistributions of wealth betweencreditors and debtors caused by unexpected inflation by issuing indexed govern-ment bonds, as in fact the Clinton administration did in 1997. Such an act insulatesholders of government debt from inflation. In addition, by setting an example, itmight encourage private borrowers and lenders to write debt contracts indexed forinflation.\\nReducing inflation might be desirable if it could be done at no cost, as some\\neconomists argue is possible. Yet this trick seems hard to carry out in practice.When economies reduce their rate of inflation, they almost always experience a pe-riod of high unemployment and low output. It is risky to believe that the centralbank could achieve credibility so quickly as to make disinflation painless.\\nIndeed, a disinflationary recession can potentially leave permanent scars on\\nthe economy. Firms in all industries reduce their spending on new plants andequipment substantially during recessions, making investment the most volatilecomponent of GDP . Even after the recession is over, the smaller stock of capital re-duces productivity, incomes, and living standards below the levels they otherwisewould have achieved. In addition, when workers become unemployed in reces-sions, they lose valuable job skills. Even after the economy has recovered, theirvalue as workers is diminished. Some economists have argued that the high un-employment in many European economies during the past decade is the aftermathof the disinflations of the 1980s.\\nWhy should policymakers put the economy through a costly, inequitable dis-\\ninflationary recession to achieve zero inflation, which may have only modest ben-efits? Economist Alan Blinder, whom Bill Clinton appointed to be vice chairman of512PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nthe Federal Reserve, argued forcefully in his book Hard Heads, Soft Hearts that\\npolicymakers should not make this choice:\\nThe costs that attend the low and moderate inflation rates experienced in the\\nUnited States and in other industrial countries appear to be quite modest—morelike a bad cold than a cancer on society. . . . As rational individuals, we do notvolunteer for a lobotomy to cure a head cold. Yet, as a collectivity, we routinelyprescribe the economic equivalent of lobotomy (high unemployment) as a curefor the inflationary cold.\\nBlinder concludes that it is better to learn to live with moderate inflation.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Explain the costs and benefits of reducing inflation to zero.\\nWhich are temporary and which are permanent?\\nSHOULD FISCAL POLICYMAKERS\\nREDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT?\\nPerhaps the most persistent macroeconomic debate in recent years has been over\\nthe finances of the federal government. Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s,the U.S. federal government spent more than it collected in tax revenue and fi-nanced this budget deficit by issuing government debt. When we studied financialmarkets in Chapter 13, we saw how budget deficits affect saving, investment, andinterest rates.\\nThis situation reversed itself in the late 1990s, when a combination of tax hikes,\\nspending cuts, and strong economic growth eliminated the government’s budgetdeficit and even produced a small budget surplus. Our fourth debate concernswhether fiscal policymakers should use this budget surplus to reduce the govern-ment debt. The alternative is to eliminate the budget surplus by cutting taxes orincreasing spending.\\nPRO: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD\\nREDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT\\nThe U.S. federal government is far more indebted today than it was two decades\\nago. In 1980, the federal debt was $710 billion; in 1999, it was $3.7 trillion. If we di-vide today’s debt by the size of the population, we learn that each person’s shareof the government debt is about $14,000.\\nThe most direct effect of the government debt is to place a burden on future\\ngenerations of taxpayers. When these debts and accumulated interest come due,future taxpayers will face a difficult choice. They can pay higher taxes, enjoy lessgovernment spending, or both, in order to make resources available to pay off thedebt and accumulated interest. Or they can delay the day of reckoning and put thegovernment into even deeper debt by borrowing once again to pay off the old debtand interest. In essence, when the government runs a budget deficit and issuesgovernment debt, it allows current taxpayers to pass the bill for some of their\\n“M Y SHARE OF THE GOVERNMENT DEBT\\nIS$14,000.”CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 513\\ngovernment spending on to future taxpayers. Inheriting such a large debt cannot\\nhelp but lower the living standard of future generations.\\nIn addition to this direct effect, budget deficits also have various macroeco-\\nnomic effects. Because budget deficits represent negative public saving, they lower\\nnational saving (the sum of private and public saving). Reduced national savingcauses real interest rates to rise and investment to fall. Reduced investment leadsover time to a smaller stock of capital. A lower capital stock reduces labor produc-tivity, real wages, and the economy’s production of goods and services. Thus,when the government increases its debt, future generations are born into an econ-omy with lower incomes as well as higher taxes.\\nThere are, nevertheless, situations in which running a budget deficit is justifi-\\nable. Throughout history, the most common cause of increased government debt iswar. When a military conflict raises government spending temporarily, it is rea-sonable to finance this extra spending by borrowing. Otherwise, taxes duringwartime would have to rise precipitously. Such high tax rates would greatly dis-tort the incentives faced by those who are taxed, leading to large deadweightlosses. In addition, such high tax rates would be unfair to current generations oftaxpayers, who already have to make the sacrifice of fighting the war.\\nSimilarly, it is reasonable to allow a rise in government debt during a tempo-\\nrary downturn in economic activity. When the economy goes into a recession, taxrevenue falls automatically, because the income tax and the payroll tax are leviedon measures of income. If the government tried to balance its budget during a re-cession, it would have to raise taxes or cut spending at a time of high unemploy-ment. Such a policy would tend to depress aggregate demand at precisely the timeit needed to be stimulated and, therefore, would tend to increase the magnitude ofeconomic fluctuations.\\nThe rise in government debt during the 1980s and 1990s, however, cannot be\\njustified by appealing to war or recession. During this period, the United Statesavoided major military conflict and major economic downturn. Nonetheless, thegovernment consistently ran a budget deficit, largely because the president andCongress found it easier to increase government spending than to increase taxes.As a result, government debt as a percentage of annual gross domestic product in-creased from 26 percent in 1980 to 50 percent in 1995, before falling back a bit to44 percent in 1999. It is hard to see any rationale for this rise in government debt.If the U.S. government had been operating with a balanced budget since 1980,today’s college graduates would be entering an economy that promised themgreater economic prosperity.\\nIt’s now time to reverse the effects of this policy mistake. A combination of\\nfiscal prudence and good luck left the U.S. government with a budget surplus inthe late 1990s and projected surpluses for subsequent years. We should use thesesurpluses to repay some of the debt that the government has accumulated. Com-pared to the alternative of cutting taxes or increasing spending, repaying the debtwould mean greater national saving, investment, and economic growth.\\nCON: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD NOT\\nREDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT\\nThe problem of government debt is often exaggerated. Although the government\\ndebt does represent a tax burden on younger generations, it is not large comparedto the average person’s lifetime income. The debt of the U.S. federal government is514 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nabout $14,000 per person. A person who works 40 years for $25,000 a year will earn\\n$1 million over his lifetime. His share of the government debt represents less than2 percent of his lifetime resources.\\nMoreover, it is misleading to view the effects of government debt in isolation.\\nThe government debt is just one piece of a large picture of how the governmentchooses to raise and spend money. In making these decisions over fiscal policy,policymakers affect different generations of taxpayers in many ways. The govern-ment’s budget deficit or surplus should be considered together with these otherpolicies.\\nFor example, suppose the government uses the budget surplus to pay off the\\ngovernment debt instead of using it to pay for increased spending on education.Does this policy make young generations better off? The government debt will besmaller when they enter the labor force, which means a smaller tax burden. Yet ifthey are less well educated than they could be, their productivity and incomes willbe lower. Many estimates of the return to schooling (the increase in a worker’swage that results from an additional year in school) find that it is quite large. Re-ducing the government debt rather than funding more education spending could,all things considered, make future generations worse off.\\nSingle-minded concern about the government debt is also dangerous because\\nit draws attention away from various other policies that redistribute income acrossgenerations. For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. federal governmentraised Social Security benefits for the elderly. It financed this higher spending byincreasing the payroll tax on the working-age population. This policy redistributedincome away from younger generations toward older generations, even thoughit did not affect the government debt. Thus, government debt is only a smallpiece of the larger issue of how government policy affects the welfare of differentgenerations.\\nTo some extent, the adverse effects of government debt can be reversed by\\nforward-looking parents. Suppose a parent is worried about the impact of thegovernment debt on his children. The parent can offset the impact simply by sav-ing and leaving a larger bequest. The bequest would enhance the children’s abilityto bear the burden of future taxes. Some economists claim that people do in factbehave this way. If this were true, higher private saving by parents would offsetthe public dissaving of budget deficits, and deficits would not affect the economy.Most economists doubt that parents are so farsighted, but some people probablydo act this way, and anyone could. Deficits give people the opportunity to con-sume at the expense of their children, but deficits do not require them to do so. Ifthe government debt actually represented a great problem facing future genera-tions, some parents would help to solve it.\\nCritics of budget deficits sometimes assert that the government debt cannot\\ncontinue to rise forever, but in fact it can. Just as a bank officer evaluating a loanapplication would compare a person’s debts to his income, we should judge theburden of the government debt relative to the size of the nation’s income. Popula-tion growth and technological progress cause the total income of the U.S. economyto grow over time. As a result, the nation’s ability to pay the interest on the gov-ernment debt grows over time as well. As long as the government debt growsmore slowly than the nation’s income, there is nothing to prevent the governmentdebt from growing forever.\\nSome numbers can put this into perspective. The real output of the U.S. econ-\\nomy grows on average about 3 percent per year. If the inflation rate is 2 percent per CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 515\\nWHEN POLICYMAKERS FACE GOVERNMENT\\nbudget surpluses, they have three op-\\ntions: cutting taxes, increasing spend-ing, or reducing the government debt.Choosing is not easy.\\nLawmakers Discover\\nThat Surpluses\\nCan Be as Vexing as Deficits\\nBYDAVIDWESSEL AND GREGHITT\\nWASHINGTON —It took politicians 15 con-\\ntentious years to eliminate the biggestfederal budget deficits since WorldWar II. Now, they are having nearly asmuch difficulty deciding what to do withthe roughly $3 trillion in surpluses pro-jected over the next 10 years.\\nThe sudden emergence of a budget\\nwindfall larger than anticipated just sixmonths ago is forcing into fast-forwarda longstanding debate over fiscal policyand the role of government.\\nOn the surface, lawmakers face a\\nsimple multiple-choice question: Shouldthe surplus be saved, spent, or devotedto tax cuts? But at its core, the debateis about profound issues that werelong suppressed by the deficit-reductionimperative:How big should government be?\\nDoAmericans prefer to  pay less intaxes or have government do more?How much should younger workers sac-rifice to support baby-boomer parentsand grandparents in retirement, and howmuch should baby-boomers set aside inadvance? How much should governmentinterfere with the workings of the marketto spread the benefits of today’s pros-perity? Is paying off debt incurred in the1980s and 1990s more or less importantthan raising spending on education andhealth or lowering taxes?\\nWith something less than unanimity,\\nRepublicans make the case for biggertax cuts and smaller government. “Re-publicans believe it’s a matter of principleto return excess tax money in Wash-ington to the families and workers whosent it here,” House Ways and MeansChairman Bill Archer, a Texas Republi-can, said on the floor of the House ofRepresentatives during last week’s tax-cut debate. “Republicans believe thatAmericans have the right to keep moreof what they earn.”\\nWhere Republicans see an over-\\ntaxed populace, however, liberal Democ-rats in Congress see “unmet needs.”\\n“The question,” says Rep. Barney\\nFrank, a Massachusetts Democrat, “isnot whether the surplus should be spentaccording to people’s wishes. Of courseit should. The question is whether itshould be spent on private goods orpublic goods.” . . .\\nThe public is split, but a new Wall\\nStreet Journal/NBC News poll suggeststhat the GOP is having trouble sellingits call for tax cuts. . . . Asked to pickjust one option for using the surplus, 46percent of the 1,007 respondents opted\\nfor spending on social programs such aseducation or a prescription-drug benefitfor Medicare recipients, 22 percentpicked paying down the federal debt, andonly 20 percent picked tax cuts. (Therest picked defense or didn’t make achoice.)\\n“We are not in a period like the\\nlate 1970s when people really despisedgovernment,” says Republican pollsterRobert Teeter, who conducted the pollwith Democrat Peter Hart. “The elec-torate is saying there are serious le-gitimate issues that the governmentshould address, and they are willing touse some of their money to do it,” Mr.Teeter adds. . . .\\nFed Chairman Greenspan continues\\nto preach the virtues of debt reduction.Although he doesn’t admit to as much,he sees virtue in gridlock. If Congressand Mr. Clinton can get appropriationsbills enacted this year, but agree onnothing else, then the surplus will auto-matically go to reducing the governmentdebt.\\nSOURCE: The Wall Street Journal, July 29, 1999,\\np. A1.\\nIN THE NEWS\\nThe Budget Surplus\\n516 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nyear, then nominal income grows at a rate of 5 percent per year. The government\\ndebt, therefore, can rise by 5 percent per year without increasing the ratio of debtto income. In 1999 the federal government debt was $3.7 trillion; 5 percent of thisfigure is $165 billion. As long as the federal budget deficit is smaller than $165 bil-lion, the policy is sustainable. There will never be any day of reckoning that forcesthe budget deficits to end or the economy to collapse.\\nIf moderate budget deficits are sustainable, there is no need for the govern-\\nment to maintain budget surpluses. Let’s put this excess of revenue over spendingto better use. The government could use these funds to pay for valuable govern-ment programs, such as increased funding for education. Or it could use them tofinance a tax cut. In the late 1990s taxes reached an historic high as a percentage ofGDP , so there is every reason to suppose that the deadweight losses of taxationreached an historic high as well. If all these taxes aren’t needed for current spend-ing, the government should return the money to the people who earned it.\\nQUICK QUIZ: Explain how reducing the government debt makes future\\ngenerations better off. What fiscal policy might improve the lives of futuregenerations more than reducing the government debt?\\nSHOULD THE TAX LAWS BE REFORMED TO\\nENCOURAGE SAVING?\\nA nation’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.\\nThis was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1. As we saw in Chapter\\n12, a nation’s productive capability, in turn, is determined largely by how much itsaves and invests for the future. Our fifth debate is whether policymakers shouldreform the tax laws to encourage greater saving and investment.\\nPRO: THE TAX LAWS SHOULD BE\\nREFORMED TO ENCOURAGE SAVING\\nA nation’s saving rate is a key determinant of its long-run economic prosperity.\\nWhen the saving rate is higher, more resources are available for investment in newplant and equipment. A larger stock of plant and equipment, in turn, raises laborproductivity, wages, and incomes. It is, therefore, no surprise that internationaldata show a strong correlation between national saving rates and measures of eco-nomic well-being.\\nAnother of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people\\nrespond to incentives. This lesson should apply to people’s decisions about howmuch to save. If a nation’s laws make saving attractive, people will save a higherfraction of their incomes, and this higher saving will lead to a more prosperousfuture.\\nUnfortunately, the U.S. tax system discourages saving by taxing the return to\\nsaving quite heavily. For example, consider a 25-year-old worker who saves $1,000\\nCHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 517\\nof her income to have a more comfortable retirement at the age of 70. If she buys a\\nbond that pays an interest rate of 10 percent, the $1,000 will accumulate at the endof 45 years to $72,900 in the absence of taxes on interest. But suppose she faces amarginal tax rate on interest income of 40 percent, which is typical of many work-ers once federal and state income taxes are added together. In this case, her after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent, and the $1,000 will accumulate at the end of 45years to only $13,800. That is, accumulated over this long span of time, the tax rateon interest income reduces the benefit of saving $1,000 from $72,900 to $13,800—or by about 80 percent.\\nThe tax code further discourages saving by taxing some forms of capital in-\\ncome twice. Suppose a person uses some of his saving to buy stock in a corpora-tion. When the corporation earns a profit from its capital investments, it first paystax on this profit in the form of the corporate income tax. If the corporation paysout the rest of the profit to the stockholder in the form of dividends, the stock-holder pays tax on this income a second time in the form of the individual incometax. This double taxation substantially reduces the return to the stockholder,thereby reducing the incentive to save.\\nThe tax laws again discourage saving if a person wants to leave his accumu-\\nlated wealth to his children (or anyone else) rather than consuming it during hislifetime. Parents can bequeath some money to their children without tax, but if thebequest becomes large, the inheritance tax rate can be as high as 55 percent. To alarge extent, concern about national saving is motivated by a desire to ensure eco-nomic prosperity for future generations. It is odd, therefore, that the tax laws dis-courage the most direct way in which one generation can help the next.\\nIn addition to the tax code, many other policies and institutions in our society\\nreduce the incentive for households to save. Some government benefits, such aswelfare and Medicaid, are means-tested; that is, the benefits are reduced for thosewho in the past have been prudent enough to save some of their income. Collegesand universities grant financial aid as a function of the wealth of the students andtheir parents. Such a policy is like a tax on wealth and, as such, discourages stu-dents and parents from saving.\\nThere are various ways in which the tax code could provide an incentive to\\nsave, or at least reduce the disincentive that households now face. Already the taxlaws give preferential treatment to some types of retirement saving. When a tax-payer puts income into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), for instance, thatincome and the interest it earns are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn at re-tirement. The tax code gives a similar tax advantage to retirement accounts that goby other names, such as 401(k), 403(b), Keogh, and profit-sharing plans. There are,however, limits to who is eligible to use these plans and, for those who are eligible,limits on the amount that can be put in them. Moreover, because there are penal-ties for withdrawal before retirement age, these retirement plans provide little in-centive for other types of saving, such as saving to buy a house or pay for college.A small step to encourage greater saving would be to expand the ability of house-holds to use such tax-advantaged savings accounts.\\nA more comprehensive approach would be to reconsider the entire basis by\\nwhich the government collects revenue. The centerpiece of the U.S. tax system isthe income tax. A dollar earned is taxed the same whether it is spent or saved.An alternative advocated by many economists is a consumption tax. Under aconsumption tax, a household pays taxes only on the basis of what it spends.Income that is saved is exempt from taxation until the saving is later withdrawn518 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\nand spent on consumption goods. In essence, a consumption tax puts all sav-\\ning automatically into a tax-advantaged savings account, much like an IRA. Aswitch from income to consumption taxation would greatly increase the incentiveto save.\\nCON: THE TAX LAWS SHOULD\\nNOT BE REFORMED TO ENCOURAGE SAVING\\nIncreasing saving may be desirable, but it is not the only goal of tax policy. Policy-\\nmakers also must be sure to distribute the tax burden fairly. The problem with pro-posals to increase the incentive to save is that they increase the tax burden on thosewho can least afford it.\\nIt is an undeniable fact that high-income households save a greater fraction of\\ntheir income than low-income households. As a result, any tax change that favorspeople who save will also tend to favor people with high income. Policies suchas tax-advantaged retirement accounts may seem appealing, but they lead to aless egalitarian society. By reducing the tax burden on the wealthy who can takeadvantage of these accounts, they force the government to raise the tax burden onthe poor.\\nMoreover, tax policies designed to encourage saving may not be effective at\\nachieving that goal. Many studies have found that saving is relatively inelastic—that is, the amount of saving is not very sensitive to the rate of return on saving.If this is indeed the case, then tax provisions that raise the effective return byreducing the taxation of capital income will further enrich the wealthy withoutinducing them to save more than they otherwise would.\\nEconomic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether a higher\\nrate of return would increase saving. The outcome depends on the relative sizeof two conflicting effects, called the substitution effect and the income effect. On\\nthe one hand, a higher rate of return raises the benefit of saving: Each dollarsaved today produces more consumption in the future. This substitution effecttends to raise saving. On the other hand, a higher rate of return lowers the needfor saving: A household has to save less to achieve any target level of consumptionin the future. This income effect tends to reduce saving. If the substitution andincome effects approximately cancel each other, as some studies suggest, thensaving will not change when lower taxation of capital income raises the rate ofreturn.\\nThere are other ways to raise national saving than by giving tax breaks to the\\nrich. National saving is the sum of private and public saving. Instead of trying toalter the tax code to encourage greater private saving, policymakers can simplyraise public saving by increasing the budget surplus, perhaps by raising taxes onthe wealthy. This offers a direct way of raising national saving and increasing pros-perity for future generations.\\nIndeed, once public saving is taken into account, tax provisions to encourage\\nsaving might backfire. Tax changes that reduce the taxation of capital incomereduce government revenue and, thereby, lead to a budget deficit. To increase na-tional saving, such a change in the tax code must stimulate private saving by morethan it reduces public saving. If this is not the case, so-called saving incentives canpotentially make matters worse.CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 519\\nQUICK QUIZ: Give three examples of how our society discourages saving.\\nWhat are the drawbacks of eliminating these disincentives?\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis chapter has considered five debates over macroeconomic policy. For each, itbegan with a controversial proposition and then offered the arguments pro andcon. If you find it hard to choose a side in these debates, you may find some com-fort in the fact that you are not alone. The study of economics does not alwaysmake it easy to choose among alternative policies. Indeed, by clarifying the in-evitable tradeoffs that policymakers face, it can make the choice more difficult.\\nDifficult choices, however, have no right to seem easy. When you hear politi-\\ncians or commentators proposing something that sounds too good to be true, itprobably is. If they sound like they are offering you a free lunch, you should lookfor the hidden price tag. Few if any policies come with benefits but no costs. Byhelping you see through the fog of rhetoric so common in political discourse, thestudy of economics should make you a better participant in our national debates.\\nN Advocates of active monetary and fiscal policy view the\\neconomy as inherently unstable and believe that policycan manage aggregate demand to offset the inherentinstability. Critics of active monetary and fiscal policyemphasize that policy affects the economy with a lagand that our ability to forecast future economicconditions is poor. As a result, attempts to stabilize theeconomy can end up being destabilizing.\\nN Advocates of rules for monetary policy argue that\\ndiscretionary policy can suffer from incompetence,abuse of power, and time inconsistency. Critics of rulesfor monetary policy argue that discretionary policy ismore flexible in responding to changing economiccircumstances.\\nN Advocates of a zero-inflation target emphasize that\\ninflation has many costs and few if any benefits.Moreover, the cost of eliminating inflation—depressedoutput and employment—is only temporary. Even thiscost can be reduced if the central bank announces acredible plan to reduce inflation, thereby directlylowering expectations of inflation. Critics of a zero-inflation target claim that moderate inflation imposesonly small costs on society, whereas the recessionnecessary to reduce inflation is quite costly.N Advocates of reducing the government debt argue that\\nthe debt imposes a burden on future generations byraising their taxes and lowering their incomes. Critics ofreducing the government debt argue that the debt isonly one small piece of fiscal policy. Single-mindedconcern about the debt can obscure the many ways inwhich the government’s tax and spending decisionsaffect different generations.\\nN Advocates of tax incentives for saving point out that our\\nsociety discourages saving in many ways, such as byheavily taxing the income from capital and by reducingbenefits for those who have accumulated wealth. Theyendorse reforming the tax laws to encourage saving,perhaps by switching from an income tax to aconsumption tax. Critics of tax incentives for savingargue that many proposed changes to stimulate savingwould primarily benefit the wealthy, who do not need atax break. They also argue that such changes might haveonly a small effect on private saving. Raising publicsaving by increasing the government’s budget surpluswould provide a more direct and equitable way toincrease national saving.\\nSummary520 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS\\n1.

       " 'When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of tradeoffs.',\n",

       " 'Because of the higher costs, these firms end up earning smallerprofits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some combination of thesethree.',\n",
       " 'Thus, while pollution regulations give us the benefit of a cleaner environ-ment and the improved health that comes with it, they have the cost of reducingthe incomes of the firms’ owners, workers, and customers.',\n",
